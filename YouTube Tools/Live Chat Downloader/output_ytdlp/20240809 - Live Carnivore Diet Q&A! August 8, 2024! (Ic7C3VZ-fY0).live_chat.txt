[01:06:04 / 2024-08-09 03:44:31 UTC] [MSG] @andyc7747: It was very shocking when I started, I could not get my fat ratio correct as it seemed unnatural but I kept adding
[01:06:10 / 2024-08-09 03:44:36 UTC] [MSG] @scoobydadog246: Yes, fancy that @DS111 ! 
[01:06:13 / 2024-08-09 03:44:39 UTC] [MSG] @DS111-b8b: @Shane Ingle Fat that is produced after cooking -- like what remains in the pan or slow-cooker. I am careful with that.
[01:06:13 / 2024-08-09 03:44:39 UTC] [MSG] @ritajean6: Fred I agee , the only butter is ghee and I can handle that. 
[01:06:19 / 2024-08-09 03:44:45 UTC] [MSG] @Fireinthedark8: Fat is either white or yellow on meat Shane
[01:06:20 / 2024-08-09 03:44:46 UTC] [MSG] @Darvit_Nu: @Shane Ingle are you drinking water within 1/2 hr before, during or 1/2 hr after meals? We try to avoid water around meals since it dilutes stomach acid & hinders proper digestion. 
[01:06:20 / 2024-08-09 03:44:46 UTC] [MSG] @loriwilson-n9t: The fat that’s cooked out of your steak

[01:06:30 / 2024-08-09 03:44:56 UTC] [MSG] @Michele-McD: Will definitely eat more fat!!!
[01:06:42 / 2024-08-09 03:45:08 UTC] [MSG] @RosalindChaffee: @Shane Ingle rendered fat is the liquid fat expressed from solid fat in meat... you can then put it into a jar and it solidifies like butter
[01:06:44 / 2024-08-09 03:45:10 UTC] [MSG] @Randomlyme88: @Following Truth! I added lamb fat, I hope you liked it!
[01:06:47 / 2024-08-09 03:45:13 UTC] [MSG] @jennifermarlow.: @stinkasscat Ack, I can only imagine, but yeah, similar here in Nova Scotia. Especially in the city. We do the best we can, though. :)
[01:07:00 / 2024-08-09 03:45:26 UTC] [MSG] @andyc7747: the worst thing that can happen about high fat is a liquid poo

[01:07:07 / 2024-08-09 03:45:34 UTC] [MSG] @D4rkBl4de: So ground beef I'm always told you jeed to cook it through and it makes the fat liquidify. do you guys half cook it? any tips?
[01:07:07 / 2024-08-09 03:45:34 UTC] [MSG] @Curious_Max: That’s why it was so juicy my wife and kids loved it
[01:07:10 / 2024-08-09 03:45:36 UTC] [MSG] @IAm-rw7gz: Water ?
[01:07:14 / 2024-08-09 03:45:40 UTC] [MSG] @ill_intent_ill_intent: I've really been enjoying eating the fat cap on my pork chops. I threw that part away for years. Shame.

[01:07:22 / 2024-08-09 03:45:48 UTC] [MSG] @6.0hhh: ok thanks for that I smoke all my steaks no grease is used or anything. and yes I drink a lot of water through the day. I'll finish a bottle before I eat and drink a full bottle during my meal
[01:07:22 / 2024-08-09 03:45:48 UTC] [MSG] @DS111-b8b: @Shane Ingle I made the mistake of sipping rendered fat from the chuck roast slow-cooker and had an issue 12 hours later. Now, I do not sip that.
[01:07:27 / 2024-08-09 03:45:53 UTC] [MSG] @KoppersKitchen: @Josie DarkBlade I eat it rare to raw and use all the fat
[01:07:35 / 2024-08-09 03:46:01 UTC] [MSG] @loriwilson-n9t: Shane try leaving fat in pan when you take your steak out
[01:07:35 / 2024-08-09 03:46:02 UTC] [MSG] @Darvit_Nu: @Following Truth! Top Tritip beef butt, chuck, sirloin, etc. mostly beef steaks.
[01:07:46 / 2024-08-09 03:46:12 UTC] [MSG] @Curious_Max: We cook our ground beef fully cooked

[01:07:58 / 2024-08-09 03:46:24 UTC] [MSG] @Fireinthedark8: Rita jean there is no ghee to be found anywhere in France, they only sell blocks of butter… so I’m on a strict lion diet, like a lion, only I cook lol
[01:08:01 / 2024-08-09 03:46:28 UTC] [MSG] @6.0hhh: thanks for all this info guys I'm taking screenshots. I'm a truck driver and you can imagine how this is inconvenient for me during the day after I eat. 🫠
[01:08:10 / 2024-08-09 03:46:36 UTC] [MSG] @D4rkBl4de: interesting. I'll cook it less so hopefully the fat stays more solid
[01:08:19 / 2024-08-09 03:46:46 UTC] [MSG] @loriwilson-n9t: Oh you grill… I guess it’s not that then
[01:08:28 / 2024-08-09 03:46:54 UTC] [MSG] @dianaparedes8344: What meat do you suggest that has good fat

[01:08:31 / 2024-08-09 03:46:57 UTC] [MSG] @scoobydadog246:  @Michele Mcdermott I tried Linzess years ago, before I came to believe no meds or mainstream medicine will help GI issues, and will cause more problems. it didn't do anything for me. 
[01:08:34 / 2024-08-09 03:47:00 UTC] [MSG] @RosalindChaffee: @Michele Mcdermott my personal experience is adding butter to bone broth works quite well to help with things like this. 
[01:08:35 / 2024-08-09 03:47:01 UTC] [MSG] @SouthernLivingTheRightWay: so butter is a no go?
[01:08:36 / 2024-08-09 03:47:02 UTC] [MSG] @ritajean6: Wow , that is good ! I
[01:08:37 / 2024-08-09 03:47:03 UTC] [MSG] @Curious_Max: Sounds weird, but does anyone else find that solid fat works better 
[01:08:47 / 2024-08-09 03:47:13 UTC] [MSG] @RosalindChaffee: rude cat
[01:08:48 / 2024-08-09 03:47:14 UTC] [MSG] @DS111-b8b: @Shane Ingle Probably don't drink so much around the digestive process -- a little sip during a meal is okay, but do not dilute your pH, I think.
[01:08:48 / 2024-08-09 03:47:14 UTC] [MSG] @Darvit_Nu: *** There are two things that can affect your stools: fat or sodium both aided by water. If you are actually eating a ton of fat & literally can not eat any more & not salting it could be the salt. 
[01:08:49 / 2024-08-09 03:47:15 UTC] [MSG] @Randomlyme88: @Following Truth! What do you like better, lamb or beef????
[01:08:54 / 2024-08-09 03:47:20 UTC] [MSG] @Fireinthedark8: Beef has the best fat Diana on a tomahawk particularly

[01:09:53 / 2024-08-09 03:48:19 UTC] [MSG] @6.0hhh: yeah I smoke my meat then cut it and put it in glass bowl. when I go to eat it, it does have a lot of liquid ("juice" that the meat sits in. maybe I should drain that before eating?
[01:10:06 / 2024-08-09 03:48:32 UTC] [MSG] @6.0hhh: I don't usually drink it but I do soak the meat in it before a bite

[01:10:18 / 2024-08-09 03:48:44 UTC] [MSG] @Fireinthedark8: I Am yeah perhaps but even then butter is dairy, and having psoriasis it makes it worse. Ghee is just refined butter at the end of the day

[01:10:44 / 2024-08-09 03:49:11 UTC] [MSG] @DS111-b8b: @Shane Ingle For me, if the meat seems dry, I load it up with butter. The rendered fat for me is risky.

[01:15:00 / 2024-08-09 03:53:26 UTC] [MSG] @jennifermarlow.: @stinkasscat I spent every day in the country when school was out. It's the only way to live, imo, and feel real. You'll get there, I know it.

[01:18:10 / 2024-08-09 03:56:36 UTC] [MSG] @teslinjoe5938: I try to eat a pound give or take. 5'7" and my weight is ranging between 130 and 132. Don't want to lose any more than that but some days I have to consume my meat in two sessions.

[01:18:24 / 2024-08-09 03:56:50 UTC] [MSG] @scoobydadog246:  @Scott it's not a carnivore thing per se. Many people feel it is better not to eat too close to bed, but some ppl don't have issue.. I believe Dr. Chaffee says he eats late at night, or he used to. 
[01:18:36 / 2024-08-09 03:57:02 UTC] [MSG] @jennifermarlow.: How about some crispy bacon, and child could get the smell ...also, those brown butter frozen bits.

[01:19:54 / 2024-08-09 03:58:20 UTC] [MSG] @jennifermarlow.: @stinkasscat It used to be, but the SAD has taken over. Salt cod, haddock, Atlantic salmon, scallops, lobster are traditional fare that I grew up on. So, yes if you are in the country. Also, game.
[01:20:06 / 2024-08-09 03:58:32 UTC] [MSG] @scoobydadog246: @AndyC77 oh, it's ok, u had no idea what I was talking about 🙂 .. I do wish I could do just water, it would be great, but yes, I've recently tried some homemade shampoo bars.. 
[01:20:28 / 2024-08-09 03:58:54 UTC] [MSG] @Darvit_Nu: I quit intentionally intermittent fasting when doc recommended I just eat when hungry & stop when I'm full-up. Now I don't even think about it. If I'm hungry at 1 am after a live, I'm going to eat lol

[01:21:41 / 2024-08-09 04:00:08 UTC] [MSG] @Fireinthedark8: Rita jean a whole shoulder of lamb is what I need for a day, and it’s more costly than a tomahawk of grass fed beef.. so I hardly ever eat lamb, once a year usually..

[01:30:16 / 2024-08-09 04:08:42 UTC] [MSG] @scribbler0077: @Jordan -yes!! Carnivore is optimal food for breastfeeding—your wife will make lots of milk

[01:31:00 / 2024-08-09 04:09:26 UTC] [MSG] @IRBD4Jesus: Honestly started to but maybe not enough Omegas.
[01:31:06 / 2024-08-09 04:09:32 UTC] [MSG] @KoppersKitchen: @IRBD4Jesus When i get inflamed i increase both and get relief within a day 
[01:31:30 / 2024-08-09 04:09:56 UTC] [MSG] @IRBD4Jesus: Maybe I need a super increase 
[01:31:32 / 2024-08-09 04:09:58 UTC] [MSG] @stinkasscat: definitely @Jennifer Marlow I loved chicken gizzards growing up and i can't find them anywhere as well as Grandma's cooking
[01:31:33 / 2024-08-09 04:09:59 UTC] [MSG] @KoppersKitchen: @IRBD4Jesus Give it a shot and let us know. 
[01:31:34 / 2024-08-09 04:10:00 UTC] [MSG] @scoobydadog246: @DS111 Interesting, I weigh the same as in high school. Then, I looked 'average', now many ppl also have called me "too thin", skinny, etc. I'm the same size, everyone else is bigger now... 
[01:31:50 / 2024-08-09 04:10:16 UTC] [MSG] @Fireinthedark8: I will try the chuck eye Rita, not this weekend though because I already did my shopping but will try next week, thanks for insisting on the chuck, maybe I can save a bit of money 😅

[01:32:16 / 2024-08-09 04:10:42 UTC] [MSG] @RosalindChaffee: @DS111 no idea what they're reacting to but if people are worried it might be worth finding out your body composition. Weight lifting might be of benefit
[01:32:18 / 2024-08-09 04:10:44 UTC] [MSG] @IRBD4Jesus: Did tens unit. It's Not helping 
[01:32:24 / 2024-08-09 04:10:50 UTC] [MSG] @gatesroyale: I'm 25
[01:32:28 / 2024-08-09 04:10:55 UTC] [MSG] @jennifermarlow.: Do a search for "local grass fed beef", and you may find a farmer that delivers a side ... but it is a big wad of cash! You need a good freezer, and will save a lot of bux buying in bulk.
[01:32:32 / 2024-08-09 04:10:58 UTC] [MSG] @DS111-b8b: @ScoobyDaDog True...so many people are obviously wayyy overweight; so we look "off."
[01:32:36 / 2024-08-09 04:11:02 UTC] [MSG] @stinkasscat: lol @Kopper's Carnivore Kitchen

[01:33:01 / 2024-08-09 04:11:27 UTC] [MSG] @RosalindChaffee: @Gates Royale depends on the amount of skin - it will help but might not do everything
[01:33:10 / 2024-08-09 04:11:36 UTC] [MSG] @IRBD4Jesus: Maybe crazy increase Omegas. Taking 600
[01:33:13 / 2024-08-09 04:11:39 UTC] [MSG] @johnburn872: her body temperature is probably low as well
[01:33:24 / 2024-08-09 04:11:50 UTC] [MSG] @KoppersKitchen: @IRBD4Jesus when i feel it getting really bad i will do just salmon, sardines and anchovies

[01:33:37 / 2024-08-09 04:12:03 UTC] [MSG] @DS111-b8b: @Rosalind I bulk up when I have more work (construction). When I take off on my BMX, my energy is super-high, and I feel so light.
[01:33:43 / 2024-08-09 04:12:10 UTC] [MSG] @KoppersKitchen: @IRBD4Jesus I do not do the sups just the fish
[01:34:02 / 2024-08-09 04:12:28 UTC] [MSG] @KoppersKitchen: @EDSON WANDER Hi there and welcome!
[01:34:13 / 2024-08-09 04:12:40 UTC] [MSG] @Fireinthedark8: DS111 I feel the same way, I don’t look bulky because I don’t lift, but I don’t look anything like most folks with some belly and who have no clue about their diet
[01:34:31 / 2024-08-09 04:12:57 UTC] [MSG] @IRBD4Jesus: Oh snap that's a lot. All week I did salmon was so over it. Maybe I'll try again 
[01:34:36 / 2024-08-09 04:13:02 UTC] [MSG] @scoobydadog246: hmm @DS111 well, if you feel good and have energy, etc. I wouldn't worry, as you said, you might have a more slight /lean build..
[01:34:42 / 2024-08-09 04:13:08 UTC] [MSG] @jennifermarlow.: @stinkasscat Organ meats are hard to come by here, as well. I wouldn't know how to cook gizzards, just learned how to cook beef heart. 
[01:34:43 / 2024-08-09 04:13:09 UTC] [MSG] @RosalindChaffee: @DS111 as long as you have energy and strength it's probably not an issue 🙂 
[01:34:50 / 2024-08-09 04:13:16 UTC] [MSG] @DS111-b8b: @Fred I don't want to look bulky...I prefer to look wiry.
[01:34:51 / 2024-08-09 04:13:17 UTC] [MSG] @stinkasscat: any time I drive by a Brazilian steak house, I honk my horn and flash my lights
[01:34:58 / 2024-08-09 04:13:24 UTC] [MSG] @scribbler0077: My diabetic 80 yr old father has been eating mostly carnivore and his blood sugar dropped big time, in fact, his pharmMD told him to eat carbs before physical activity

[01:37:33 / 2024-08-09 04:15:59 UTC] [MSG] @DS111-b8b: @Fred I don't know how Chaffee maintains all that bulk. He says he does not have time for the gym much anymore...but he knows how and how much to eat and was a professional athlete.

[01:39:41 / 2024-08-09 04:18:08 UTC] [MSG] @gatesroyale: I had a carne asada burrito the other day but was not worth leaving ketosis
[01:39:49 / 2024-08-09 04:18:15 UTC] [MSG] @gatesroyale: I did serious amount of exercise and sauna and got back into it within 24 hours
[01:39:56 / 2024-08-09 04:18:23 UTC] [MSG] @DS111-b8b: I do not like green eggs and ham...and I do not like iguana.
[01:40:08 / 2024-08-09 04:18:34 UTC] [MSG] @andyc7747: @Rosalind Oh it's fine, Thanks for the concern but I am thriving, I tell them science but they can't get off the sugar.

[01:40:19 / 2024-08-09 04:18:45 UTC] [MSG] @Fireinthedark8: DS111 he eats a carnivore diet and not a lion diet. People who eat eggs bulk more, that’s how Anthony maintains all the muscle, and he eats a lot too
[01:40:19 / 2024-08-09 04:18:45 UTC] [MSG] @gatesroyale: felt the low energy fast and crash right after for five hours which is crazy af

[01:40:30 / 2024-08-09 04:18:56 UTC] [MSG] @RosalindChaffee: @AndyC77 sugar is a drug and it's really hard to get off of particularly when it's so normalized
[01:40:32 / 2024-08-09 04:18:58 UTC] [MSG] @Darvit_Nu: I always hated squash! I can't digest corn either. I am a terribad native american 🤣 (as a kid I called squash "Squish" because it was detestable.)
[01:40:57 / 2024-08-09 04:19:23 UTC] [MSG] @andyc7747: @Rosalind Oh I know it. At least my sister admits she is an addict.

[01:41:37 / 2024-08-09 04:20:03 UTC] [MSG] @Fireinthedark8: Rita jean any spice inflames my psoriatic butt like crazy, I can’t do that, same effect with citrus fruits and vegetables……..

[01:41:46 / 2024-08-09 04:20:12 UTC] [MSG] @Darvit_Nu: @J W it very well could be oxalate dumping. Drink lots of water to flush it out & you could also eat a little bit of cheese to bind the oxalate & get it out of your body IF you aren't triggered by it
[01:41:48 / 2024-08-09 04:20:14 UTC] [MSG] @RosalindChaffee: His feelings on squash are not moderate
[01:41:54 / 2024-08-09 04:20:21 UTC] [MSG] @DS111-b8b: @Darvit Nu "Squish" sounds just...wrong.

[01:42:07 / 2024-08-09 04:20:33 UTC] [MSG] @andyc7747: @Rosalind I bet, you must be doing great abstaining, I just quit my last addiction, Coffee. 
[01:42:08 / 2024-08-09 04:20:34 UTC] [MSG] @gatesroyale: it's weird how much I like chicken wing

[01:42:39 / 2024-08-09 04:21:05 UTC] [MSG] @Darvit_Nu: @DS111 lmao it's why I called it that. I did NOT want to eat it & couldn't convince the dog to eat it for me either haha!!!

[01:42:44 / 2024-08-09 04:21:10 UTC] [MSG] @Fireinthedark8: Ds111 no mate, Chaffee is carnivore, he eats everything, but if you can tolerate eggs eat them you will bulk a bit more, lion makes one extra lean
