[00:07:08 / 2025-09-30 04:18:16 UTC] [MSG] @Darvit_Nu: @MagnaFreaQ it does take a few months for fat conversion to really kick in. Your energy levels will even out & become much more steady. It kind of sneaks up on us & we realize it after it happens.

[00:08:11 / 2025-09-30 04:19:19 UTC] [MSG] @cherylsheldon2012: ??????? Hi Dr Chaffee , is there a break through time with carnivore because I always break the carnivore way with eating carbs . Or is it just discipline? 
[00:08:40 / 2025-09-30 04:19:48 UTC] [MSG] @partndn: Is this really live? or one of those posts that fakes me out? 
[00:08:45 / 2025-09-30 04:19:53 UTC] [MSG] @KoppersKitchen: @Cheryl Sheldon Some people will say 21 days, however we are all different. It is about the mindset going in.

[00:21:06 / 2025-09-30 04:32:14 UTC] [MSG] @KoppersKitchen: @Gabriel Hoey First and foremost you need to heal, the weight is a symptom. Are you currently eating keto or carnivore?

[00:21:52 / 2025-09-30 04:33:00 UTC] [MSG] @Darvit_Nu: @William Miles I wouldn't recommend caffeine tabs as they are lab made & very concentrated. Going pure carnivore will give consistent energy without the crashes if you eat enough fat with your meat.
[00:22:00 / 2025-09-30 04:33:08 UTC] [MSG] @chris_carnivore_calisthenics: @Gabriel Hoey Start with the basics of fatty red meat, and don't focus on losing weight right away. You may need to do some healing first. Also, as you begin body recomposition, you may gain muscle

[00:52:41 / 2025-09-30 05:03:49 UTC] [MSG] @Jonathan-r9e5p: Hi Billy, have you tried tapering down on the bacon? Last time I did keto diet, I found that when i removed bacon i felt EVEN BETTER!
[00:52:52 / 2025-09-30 05:04:00 UTC] [MSG] @AP-P4P: After being on carnivore for a month or so and say i wanted to transition back to “normal” diet. Is it safe to do so? 
[00:52:59 / 2025-09-30 05:04:06 UTC] [MSG] @KoppersKitchen: @Hoho3444 perfectly fine, just make sure you are not eating farmed fish

[00:53:20 / 2025-09-30 05:04:28 UTC] [MSG] @agent99-0: what about cane and coconut sugar?
[00:53:28 / 2025-09-30 05:04:36 UTC] [MSG] @johnw362: the problem for me is that i get massive amounts of so called studies on how you'll literally die from colon cancer if you do dont consume fiber, all the studies show increasing fiber has decreased it

[00:54:52 / 2025-09-30 05:05:59 UTC] [MSG] @Darvit_Nu: @agent99 sugar cane & coconut are plants & have toxins. The point of eliminating sweeteners is to become metabolically healthy & prevent or heal disease. Including sweeteners will derail progress.

[00:56:18 / 2025-09-30 05:07:26 UTC] [MSG] @Darvit_Nu: @Johnny Armani that's because those studies are financed by companies invested in the production of the fiber & the drugs or surgery centers to treat it. Fear mongering to force people to consume it.
[00:56:19 / 2025-09-30 05:07:27 UTC] [MSG] @OFFICIALPGBEATS: Is monk fruit sugar the same?

[00:57:17 / 2025-09-30 05:08:24 UTC] [MSG] @chris_carnivore_calisthenics: @Albert 1 month on Carnivore really isn't enough time to get properly fat-adapted. It's best to aim for 90 days, before considering switching back. Switching back to SAD is pretty sad, but (cont.)

[00:59:05 / 2025-09-30 05:10:13 UTC] [MSG] @KoppersKitchen: @PGBEATS I would highly rec you look deeply into it, you are subbing one thing for another
[00:59:07 / 2025-09-30 05:10:15 UTC] [MSG] @Darvit_Nu: @PGBEATS Monk fruit still comes from a plant & is still a carbohydrate. It also still has 4 g of carbs per measuring level teaspoon like sugar. Over 4 g of carbs per meal is toxic to our bodies. 
[00:59:32 / 2025-09-30 05:10:39 UTC] [MSG] @Aussiefromdownunder1973: I feel great and I do omad
[00:59:39 / 2025-09-30 05:10:46 UTC] [MSG] @chris_carnivore_calisthenics: @Albert (cont.) but some folks struggle on Carnivore during the adaptation phase and think switching back is OK. IMHO, it's not 'safe' to go back to SAD...way too many toxins and nutrient deficiencies
[00:59:41 / 2025-09-30 05:10:49 UTC] [MSG] @Jonathan-r9e5p: @Billy Poon The problem with bacon is there aren't good grass-fed options available. I believe even organic bacon is grain fed which isnt ideal

[01:06:17 / 2025-09-30 05:17:25 UTC] [MSG] @chris_carnivore_calisthenics: @Albert If you need variety to keep you on track, you can add a little other things like seasonings back in, just check labeling to avoid dextrose, anti-caking agents, etc. Grass-fed butter is good
[01:06:58 / 2025-09-30 05:18:06 UTC] [MSG] @billybpoon: Hi Jonathan, thanks! I'm definitely using carnivore as a foundation in terms of giving the body and mind the fuel it needs. I am just going very slow on tapering but been great so far.

[01:12:14 / 2025-09-30 05:23:22 UTC] [MSG] @chris_carnivore_calisthenics: @Kaiden Whitlow This is very common during the adaptation phase. Your body is learning to change from using carbs for energy, to using fat for energy. Supplementing with electrolytes should help
