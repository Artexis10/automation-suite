[01:33:36 / 2024-05-08 04:05:13 UTC] [MSG] @Darvit_Nu: @Dani Chia seeds are the plant's "baby". Seeds of plants are anti-nutrients & directly block nutrient absorption & can cause IBS, leaky gut, & malnutrition. Carnivore & seed eating contraindicate.

[01:43:14 / 2024-05-08 04:14:51 UTC] [MSG] @Darvit_Nu: @Laura Lee I would highly suggest either watching Dr C's how to begin carnivore videos. There is a LOT of information in our lives & it's a lot for a beginner to take in all at once/in one sitting.
[01:43:27 / 2024-05-08 04:15:04 UTC] [MSG] @KoppersKitchen: @Marisa Marie do not discontinue any meds without speaking to your physician, but carnivore will help. Just make sure you monitor closely so it does not drop too low

[01:43:37 / 2024-05-08 04:15:14 UTC] [MSG] @RosalindChaffee: @Marisa Marie meditation is the most effective treatment for HBP bar none. Use the diet it's totally safe and may well help as well but take some time each day to clear your mind and breathe. 🙂
