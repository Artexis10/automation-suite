[00:00:00 / 2024-07-26 01:12:50 UTC] [MSG] @Darvit_Nu: I used my phone to look up the nutrition labels of deli meats for years. Then I gave up and bought a "press ham maker" so I can make it for my family with clean ingredients. It cost around $20

[00:00:00 / 2024-07-26 01:15:44 UTC] [MSG] @russelthornton5212: I'm good. I've realized that it's pretty simple, just eat fatty meat and drink water and give the process time. I believe that most are impatient and I totally understand but it's about discipline.
[00:00:00 / 2024-07-26 01:15:46 UTC] [MSG] @Darvit_Nu: oh nooooo well, Rick & Nick will have to flip for it!

[00:04:40 / 2024-07-26 01:26:34 UTC] [MSG] @PolishMike1993: Drinking hydrogen water makes sense if you are doing everything else right and want that 1% extra improvement in health. Otherwise, it's much cheaper to change other lifestyle choices instead

[00:40:04 / 2024-07-26 02:01:57 UTC] [MSG] @Darvit_Nu: @Russel Thornton it depends on the cut of meat & how much fat is trimmed off. The animal & cut of meat causes the fat to protein ratios to vary.

[00:42:02 / 2024-07-26 02:03:56 UTC] [MSG] @PolishMike1993: 1lb of beef already has at least 80g of protein so can’t you have 2lbs a day. It’s not that much
