[01:35:21 / 2024-05-01 03:59:54 UTC] [MSG] @nickolwilson2212: Can I add olive oil to the meats?
[01:35:25 / 2024-05-01 03:59:58 UTC] [MSG] @scoobydadog246: Interesting about the eyes, I've heard a couple people say their eyes got bluer. I wonder if it is that yellow issue..
[01:35:25 / 2024-05-01 03:59:58 UTC] [MSG] @Darvit_Nu: For the chat that are gaining weight ... you could be under or over eating. Under is more common on carnivore. You could use a tracking app for a day or two to see how much or little you're consuming.
[01:35:25 / 2024-05-01 03:59:59 UTC] [MSG] @sho-na: Not to my knowledge

[01:36:22 / 2024-05-01 04:00:55 UTC] [MSG] @chris_carnivore_calisthenics: @Nickol Wilson No. It's plant based and cut with toxic seed oils most of the time

[01:37:25 / 2024-05-01 04:01:58 UTC] [MSG] @cj548: olive oil has four times the linoleic acid as butter. so you should use butter
[01:37:34 / 2024-05-01 04:02:08 UTC] [MSG] @sho-na: Thank you Heidi. I will check her out!
[01:37:38 / 2024-05-01 04:02:11 UTC] [MSG] @chris_carnivore_calisthenics: @Shona W Yes. I cured my fatty liver on Carnivore
[01:37:42 / 2024-05-01 04:02:15 UTC] [MSG] @Darvit_Nu: @Viking Cat I would eat a higher fat carnivore diet, eat more frequently & aim for at least a small meal within 1/2 hr of getting up. Fat & eating usually calms cortisol & ends the "famine" stressors

[01:38:09 / 2024-05-01 04:02:42 UTC] [MSG] @NickSheesenYT: Enamagon, your brain is deficient in cholesterol is my guess. Either way carnivore will help massively
