[00:00:00 / 2024-03-01 01:04:53 UTC] [MSG] @Darvit_Nu: @ItIsYourMom yea non animal foods really bite back. Best thing to do is jump back on the wagon & ride it out. Your body will heal, it just will take a bit of time to recover.

[01:40:09 / 2024-03-01 02:47:23 UTC] [MSG] @Darvit_Nu: @ScoobyDaDog I boiled the flax seeds in water & while still hot strained it into a jar. It kept the curls instead of frizz with my hair staying soft & shiny. Lasted a few weeks in the fridge. 🙂
