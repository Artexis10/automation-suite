[00:00:00 / 2024-04-17 02:32:26 UTC] [MSG] @NickSheesenYT: Hiya S Jak 🙋
[00:00:00 / 2024-04-17 02:32:29 UTC] [MSG] @KoppersKitchen: @Time_Traveler_Karen LOL. He was working his way over here when I got off the call!
[00:00:00 / 2024-04-17 02:32:33 UTC] [MSG] @Darvit_Nu: @Tim Gee K2 reportedly helps calcium go to bones & teeth vs into soft tissue. The issue is, you also need enough magnesium to promote the proper depositing in skeletal bone as well. 
[00:00:00 / 2024-04-17 02:32:34 UTC] [MSG] @LaurieR2255: I know @Darvit! And it's frustrating that he can accomplish so much, and I can expect so little from my actual doctor. Oh, he doesn't have time to learn anything new, read or listen when I speak!
[00:00:00 / 2024-04-17 02:33:15 UTC] [MSG] @KoppersKitchen: @Laurel Roeder Isnt it just awful how prevalent that is too! It is very depressing

[00:00:00 / 2024-04-17 02:33:31 UTC] [MSG] @PatFarrell-mo5gg: '????' Hi I am a heart transplant recipient. Will the carnivore diet improve my immune system to the point of causing my anti rejection drugs not to be effective?
[00:00:00 / 2024-04-17 02:33:46 UTC] [MSG] @Darvit_Nu: @Laurel Roeder SO WELL SAID!!!! Yes! I am with you 100% on it. Just got the last bill from my Dr. My next checkup will most likely be elsewhere.

[00:00:00 / 2024-04-17 02:37:30 UTC] [MSG] @Time_Traveler_Karen: @ScoobyDaDog 😥 Have you tried using only the yolks? I have heard the whites do bother some people
[00:00:00 / 2024-04-17 02:37:31 UTC] [MSG] @Darvit_Nu: @Laurel Roeder absolutely! It's refreshing to see a Dr. so passionate about helping people & spreading the TRUTH, not what someone just paid him to say to keep his job. 🙄
[00:00:00 / 2024-04-17 02:37:37 UTC] [MSG] @PatFarrell-mo5gg: Thank you, I really like the carnivore diet, I've lost 10.5 pounds since starting last Thursday.
[00:00:00 / 2024-04-17 02:37:45 UTC] [MSG] @scoobydadog246: @Pat Farrell so improving your immune system would only make the rejection stronger; so not sure if would help here. but will be interesting to hear what doc says 🙂 
[00:00:00 / 2024-04-17 02:37:52 UTC] [MSG] @NickSheesenYT: S Jak, we're all well, good to have you here 👍
