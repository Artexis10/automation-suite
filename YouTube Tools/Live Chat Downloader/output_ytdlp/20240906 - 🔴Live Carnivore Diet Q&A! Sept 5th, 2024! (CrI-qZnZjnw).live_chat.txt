[00:02:45 / 2024-09-06 02:04:45 UTC] [MSG] @Darvit_Nu: Animals are in ketosis because of the absence of any carbohydrates along with periods of fasting if their intended meal escapes. The Bacteria in the intestines digest the fiber they excrete ketones.

[00:12:01 / 2024-09-06 02:14:01 UTC] [MSG] @Darvit_Nu: @Inky it's not necessary to schedule fasting on carnivore. It mimics fasting in the absence of carbs. However, it often causes us to naturally not eat as often due to satiety. 
[00:12:10 / 2024-09-06 02:14:11 UTC] [MSG] @Inky-Art: I make sure I eat a 1:1 protein/fat but could go with maybe 1,000 calories every two days

[00:24:44 / 2024-09-06 02:26:45 UTC] [MSG] @RosalindChaffee: @Inky some of the things you stopped can cause withdrawal issues. I started feeling awful for a while when I finally (FINALLY) gave up diet soda... 
[00:24:45 / 2024-09-06 02:26:45 UTC] [MSG] @pabeader1941: @IceCold Motivation Add butter, beef tallow and other animal fats.

[00:27:41 / 2024-09-06 02:29:42 UTC] [MSG] @RosalindChaffee: LMNT is what he recommends because they have one without sweeteners and flavorings but the point is the balance you need may not be what is in the supplement. Muscle cramps is often Magnesium.

[00:35:17 / 2024-09-06 02:37:17 UTC] [MSG] @Darvit_Nu: @Smiling4u the whole "we need fiber" is a truth hidden within a blatent lie. The truth is we need the muscle fiber & connective tissues in muscle meats of animals. They twisted it to plant fiber (lie)

[01:59:40 / 2024-09-06 04:01:40 UTC] [MSG] @Tradefy: If you guys face issues with your electrolytes, some war milk will help. The small amount of carbs makes sure you are holding onto your electrolytes + in milk there is a lot of potassium.

[02:00:56 / 2024-09-06 04:02:56 UTC] [MSG] @Tradefy: Additionally, raw milk doesn't cause blood sugar spikes or digestive issues in case someone is worried and if you want to handle a few carbs
[02:01:03 / 2024-09-06 04:03:04 UTC] [MSG] @Darvit_Nu: @Richard Rippel you can do anywhere from 1 g to 2 g of fat to 1 g of protein ... it's whatever makes you feel the best.

[02:02:01 / 2024-09-06 04:04:02 UTC] [MSG] @KoppersKitchen: @Mauricio Baquero Fat bites are great to fight cravings, as soon as you start to get one grab a fat bite or two, or even suck/chew on some clean beef jerky

[02:03:49 / 2024-09-06 04:05:49 UTC] [MSG] @Darvit_Nu: @AndyC77 some people are sensitive to the histamine in aged meat. It's most often people with autoimmune conditions or issues that trigger histamine or pain loops to set off. Most do fine with it.

[02:08:27 / 2024-09-06 04:10:27 UTC] [MSG] @andyc7747: Sauerkraut is fine if you like it in my experience. Better than unfermented plants at least.

[02:08:52 / 2024-09-06 04:10:52 UTC] [MSG] @beefesurient: @Heidi's Here & There A tiny amount chewed with your meat on occasion. make sure it only has organic cabbage, sea salt, and water and it's naturally fermented.

[02:09:47 / 2024-09-06 04:11:48 UTC] [MSG] @Tradefy: @Inky its more likely that you lack magnesium
[02:09:47 / 2024-09-06 04:11:48 UTC] [MSG] @jennifermarlow.: @Inky Yes - potassium bicarbonate, buy it in bulk at the wine/beer making store.

[02:10:59 / 2024-09-06 04:12:59 UTC] [MSG] @Darvit_Nu: @Inky you could try electrolytes or even just a magnesium citrate supplement especially 1/2 to 1 hr before bed. Mag. Cit. is the best form of magnesium for muscle cramping & most absorbable. 
[02:11:00 / 2024-09-06 04:13:01 UTC] [MSG] @RosalindChaffee: @Inky if you like baths get epsom salts - i'ts magnesium and you can absorb through the skin
[02:11:03 / 2024-09-06 04:13:03 UTC] [MSG] @Inky-Art: @Rosalind how long should I try the Magnesium first to see if it works before trying the Potassium?
