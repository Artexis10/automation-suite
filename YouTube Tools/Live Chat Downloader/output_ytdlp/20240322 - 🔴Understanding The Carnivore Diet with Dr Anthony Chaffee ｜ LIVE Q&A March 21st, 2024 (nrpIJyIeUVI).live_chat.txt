[00:41:44 / 2024-03-22 01:50:15 UTC] [MSG] @ChadThundercook: Therefore, you could have an exaggerated response compared to before carnivore because you haven't been beating your immune system down anymore. Happens with garlic, onions, cheese, etc.

[00:50:33 / 2024-03-22 01:59:04 UTC] [MSG] @ChadThundercook: A Rehan - yes, the stones are ultimately a result of carbohydrates and not reabsorbing bile correctly from the GI tract excreting the bile (should reabsorb and store 90+% in the gallbladder).

[00:51:16 / 2024-03-22 01:59:47 UTC] [MSG] @scoobydadog246: @mingkee27 CoQ10 is made from cholesterol, which is carried in the LDL particles. Statins block CoQ10 production - often causing muscle problems in pp

[01:14:14 / 2024-03-22 02:22:45 UTC] [MSG] @Darvit_Nu: @Dave Naga iodized salt has dextrose (sugar) in it to "bind" the iodine to the sodium chloride. It's why I avoid it

[01:15:41 / 2024-03-22 02:24:12 UTC] [MSG] @ChadThundercook: I mentioned snake juice, if you're concerned about electrolytes, overall, but if you're having cramps, you can buy pure potassium chloride (not the no-Salt that contains other chemicals) and "salt"
