[00:36:06 / 2025-11-18 03:11:49 UTC] [MSG] @FloridaSunshine-s7m: @TheGreatWorkContinues If you're not having symptoms of constipation, you're fine. If your body is using all the food you eat as fuel, there's very little waste. Less waste= less #2

[00:37:15 / 2025-11-18 03:12:58 UTC] [MSG] @Darvit_Nu: @TheGreatWorkContinues poop varies based on food & water intake, salt intake, and how much of the food you ate you used for fuel/repair. It's the type of poo that matters more than the frequency.
[00:37:15 / 2025-11-18 03:12:59 UTC] [MSG] @FloridaSunshine-s7m: @TheGreatWorkContinues The human body utilizes something lik 90% of red meat. So like 10% will turn into waste. My percentages might be a bit off but it's something like that.

[01:52:30 / 2025-11-18 04:28:15 UTC] [MSG] @Darvit_Nu: @PRIMITIVEFARMMOM Skin tags are the #1 sign of insulin resistance & high blood glucose! Losing them is a GREAT sign that your body is doing much better with balanced hormones. Keep up the good work! 
[01:53:18 / 2025-11-18 04:29:04 UTC] [MSG] @chris_carnivore_calisthenics: I like my steaks seared with crispy fat and blue inside. 😋
[01:53:24 / 2025-11-18 04:29:09 UTC] [MSG] @CARNIVOREFARMMOM: I don’t have them! lol 😂 I was congratulating Diane . My confusion 🥰
[01:53:34 / 2025-11-18 04:29:19 UTC] [MSG] @Darvit_Nu: some wild game can transmit diseases to people if they don't freeze the meat & cook it to the proper temp & doneness for safety. 
[01:53:50 / 2025-11-18 04:29:36 UTC] [MSG] @hectordeanda9133: Blue inside? What on earth??
[01:54:15 / 2025-11-18 04:30:00 UTC] [MSG] @KoppersKitchen: @christopherthompson3313 You are soooooooooooooooooo lucky I had those HUGE wings earlier!!! That is the first time I had turkey in over 2 years. I forgot how fatty good the wings were!
[01:54:19 / 2025-11-18 04:30:04 UTC] [MSG] @CARNIVOREFARMMOM: I’m did not know that about skin tags and insulin that’s fascinating! My skin bumps on the back of my arms cleared up tho:)
[01:54:42 / 2025-11-18 04:30:27 UTC] [MSG] @KoppersKitchen: @Darvit_Nu Yes Wild salmon for one! I always freeze before Fen or I eat it
[01:54:44 / 2025-11-18 04:30:29 UTC] [MSG] @bridesbiscuit: I do like some of my beef served with the bell still around it's neck..
[01:54:45 / 2025-11-18 04:30:30 UTC] [MSG] @Darvit_Nu: @hectordeanda9133 black & blue refers to seared on the outside & essentially raw in the center. 😉 It's how I usually eat my steaks.
[01:55:20 / 2025-11-18 04:31:06 UTC] [MSG] @FaustFuels: Qqq: When you say dairy, do you include butter? 
[01:55:22 / 2025-11-18 04:31:08 UTC] [MSG] @chris_carnivore_calisthenics: @hectordeanda9133 'Blue' is a term for very rare to raw inside, because the meat can look slightly purplish in color.
[01:55:23 / 2025-11-18 04:31:09 UTC] [MSG] @SvetlanaVladimirova8590: Mice prefer cheese
[01:55:33 / 2025-11-18 04:31:19 UTC] [MSG] @Kinkle_Z: Big Food wants to blame cancers on meat....for obvious reasons.

[01:55:40 / 2025-11-18 04:31:25 UTC] [MSG] @DIanaCOL4224: KoppersKitchen, Thank you.
[01:55:57 / 2025-11-18 04:31:43 UTC] [MSG] @KoppersKitchen: Blue is just another term for raw
[01:56:00 / 2025-11-18 04:31:45 UTC] [MSG] @carnivore-muscle: @Darvit yeah, neurological disorders do usually require more salt. I've not come across a client with a different experience yet
[01:56:10 / 2025-11-18 04:31:55 UTC] [MSG] @hectordeanda9133: Thanks for clarifying guys 😁

[01:56:22 / 2025-11-18 04:32:08 UTC] [MSG] @chris_carnivore_calisthenics: @KoppersKitchen That sounds so yummy with the butter topping that you mentioned. 😋😋😋
[01:56:24 / 2025-11-18 04:32:09 UTC] [MSG] @CARNIVOREFARMMOM: Faust whether to omit butter is a very personal one😘
[01:57:09 / 2025-11-18 04:32:54 UTC] [MSG] @Kinkle_Z: I love salt but then... I have good kidneys.

[01:58:19 / 2025-11-18 04:34:04 UTC] [MSG] @FaustFuels: I’m having a weight loss stall on my last 11 pounds are so and I’m going to cut the dairy to see if that helps and I’m wondering if I need to cut the butter too

[01:59:23 / 2025-11-18 04:35:09 UTC] [MSG] @carnivore-muscle: Anthony is bang on about Indian meat - they represent the negative data on cattle ranching meat quality on the globe. Poor hygiene and welfare standards of their animals
[01:59:32 / 2025-11-18 04:35:17 UTC] [MSG] @chris_carnivore_calisthenics: @FaustFuels Yes, for those who can tolerate the dairy in butter. Folks with dairy intolerance, can use ghee, which is clarified butter (dairy solids removed).
[01:59:35 / 2025-11-18 04:35:20 UTC] [MSG] @Kinkle_Z: I am acutely aware of the bacteria around me and possible parasites in meat and I use that knowledge to my advantage.
[01:59:44 / 2025-11-18 04:35:30 UTC] [MSG] @CARNIVOREFARMMOM: Faustfuels I don’t know what weight your at / height. But I found that when I loosen up on my dairy that it slowed / stalled my weight loss( I had lost 17 pounds at that point
[01:59:47 / 2025-11-18 04:35:32 UTC] [MSG] @Darvit_Nu: @White-o8w there is no problem with having a good bone broth daily. There is good nutrition in it. As long as you're eating meat & fat as well, have at it. 😄
[01:59:55 / 2025-11-18 04:35:41 UTC] [MSG] @melodysillemanruddell5375: I'm going to start bone broth tomorrow instead of coffee. the beef stock pan is hot on the stove with lots of bones.
[02:00:15 / 2025-11-18 04:36:00 UTC] [MSG] @FuzzyBooger: Are chicken livers good as beef livers, Doctor?

[02:00:54 / 2025-11-18 04:36:39 UTC] [MSG] @chris_carnivore_calisthenics: I'm currently using raw heavy cream for its nutritional value and part of a 'lean bulk'.
[02:01:03 / 2025-11-18 04:36:48 UTC] [MSG] @Kinkle_Z: I use coconut oil for a lotion.
[02:01:46 / 2025-11-18 04:37:31 UTC] [MSG] @carnivore-muscle: the only skincare I used or hygiene product is beef dripping, with the exception of hand wash which is organic
[02:01:53 / 2025-11-18 04:37:38 UTC] [MSG] @FaustFuels: I’ve lost 35 lbs, down from 181, I’m 5’5 and the goal is 135. I still see a lot of subcutaneous fat so I know I have more to lose. I figured cutting the dairy would be a good first step for stall 
[02:01:59 / 2025-11-18 04:37:44 UTC] [MSG] @chris_carnivore_calisthenics: Bill Nott is a perfect example of what Doc is speaking about.

[02:02:23 / 2025-11-18 04:38:08 UTC] [MSG] @CARNIVOREFARMMOM: Faustfuels congratulations!
[02:02:35 / 2025-11-18 04:38:20 UTC] [MSG] @Darvit_Nu: @Kinkle_Z I do too! Have you tried whipping it? omg it's so luxurious! Melt it then as it cools, use whisk attachment on a hand mixer or a whisk stick immersion blender... it gets so soft & melts in. 
[02:02:55 / 2025-11-18 04:38:40 UTC] [MSG] @chris_carnivore_calisthenics: @FaustFuels 💯 Correct!
[02:03:02 / 2025-11-18 04:38:47 UTC] [MSG] @Kinkle_Z: right! No exercise until 50 pounds within goal weight for me.

[02:04:08 / 2025-11-18 04:39:53 UTC] [MSG] @Darvit_Nu: I make my own deodorant with coconut oil & tallow too... using the whip method & adding Magnesium hydroxide & a little bit of baking soda. My family loves it & it works way better than store deodorant
[02:04:09 / 2025-11-18 04:39:55 UTC] [MSG] @AB-ry4qi: can too much artificial sweeteners increase you calcium score even if you are eating low surgar?

[02:04:41 / 2025-11-18 04:40:26 UTC] [MSG] @Kinkle_Z: This is a repeat question... isn't it?
[02:04:45 / 2025-11-18 04:40:31 UTC] [MSG] @melodysillemanruddell5375: I have lost over 30 lbs since the first of the year. I had no expectations on this way of eating but I really wish I had taken my measurements.
[02:04:52 / 2025-11-18 04:40:37 UTC] [MSG] @Darvit_Nu: @Kinkle_Z let me know what you think if you do make some whipped to try! It was a game changer for us not having hard clumps in the oil! 
[02:04:57 / 2025-11-18 04:40:42 UTC] [MSG] @CARNIVOREFARMMOM: Faustfuels I went from 180- 135 on keto then bounced back up . Started carnivore at 139 in 6 weeks eatting meat eggs touch of butter ( for the pan) and a tiny heavy cream in my coffee ,
