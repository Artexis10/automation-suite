[00:26:39 / 2024-03-27 02:53:47 UTC] [MSG] @CarnivoreishChip: @Jesus Reyna no way to tell what is best for you. Learn as much as you can and experiment. Every person is differnt. 
[00:26:41 / 2024-03-27 02:53:48 UTC] [MSG] @123ShaunSmith: He’d had a rough work week. Thanks Doc we will monitor and make an appointment. 
[00:26:42 / 2024-03-27 02:53:49 UTC] [MSG] @theresav2479: @kopper’s Carnivore Kitchen I eat ketogenic but not a strict carnivore. I would miss dairy
[00:26:54 / 2024-03-27 02:54:02 UTC] [MSG] @OaktownGirl: @Kooper I think the cheese (on the rare occasions I had it) was flaring up histamine issues (nasal and chest congestion).
[00:27:05 / 2024-03-27 02:54:12 UTC] [MSG] @KoppersKitchen: @ItascaPatriot Thank you for the question, let us know how he is doing

[00:28:21 / 2024-03-27 02:55:28 UTC] [MSG] @Darvit_Nu: @Jesus Reyna you should eat at least 2 meals to get enough digested nutrition for absorption. Forced fasting isn't necessary w/o sugar. organ meats aren't needed unless there's a deficiency 
[00:28:26 / 2024-03-27 02:55:33 UTC] [MSG] @OaktownGirl: @Ade Larsen I can't wait to have that when I come visit you! 🙂

[00:31:37 / 2024-03-27 02:58:44 UTC] [MSG] @Darvit_Nu: @Janet Tocatlian it's normal to have higher glucose first thing in the AM. Your liver pushes a dose of glucose through to wake you up & prep you for the day. As long as it lowers naturally it's normal
[00:31:40 / 2024-03-27 02:58:47 UTC] [MSG] @LittleIAO: @Darvit Nu are you aware of anyone being able to be carnivore with both a removed gallbladder and acute pancreatitis?
[00:31:46 / 2024-03-27 02:58:53 UTC] [MSG] @JtxCarnivore: DS111- ☺ Baked is for sure safer than eating smoked meats daily- now I know about histamine intolerance! Being more careful! 
[00:31:50 / 2024-03-27 02:58:57 UTC] [MSG] @KoppersKitchen: @Boomer1964 I would not stop any Rx without taling to your Dr
[00:31:53 / 2024-03-27 02:59:00 UTC] [MSG] @CarnivoreViolinGirl: Q why do doctors not tell their patients that cholesterol testing should be a fasting test
[00:32:03 / 2024-03-27 02:59:10 UTC] [MSG] @adelarsen9776: How does a Statin get rid of coronary plaque ? It doesn't. The best way to remove plaque is with Ketones, K2 and D3 and that happens with a clean carnivore regime.

[00:32:57 / 2024-03-27 03:00:04 UTC] [MSG] @JtxCarnivore: Amanda Violin- docs don’t get very good training on any of that unless they do independent learning like Chaffee does.

[00:33:13 / 2024-03-27 03:00:21 UTC] [MSG] @Darvit_Nu: @Rezial yes Dr. C was just talking to someone the end of last week about that. He said if anything the lack of roller coaster between sugar & insulin can allow it to calm down & heal. 
[00:33:21 / 2024-03-27 03:00:28 UTC] [MSG] @JtxCarnivore: Ade Larson- congrats!

[00:34:19 / 2024-03-27 03:01:26 UTC] [MSG] @JtxCarnivore: I have never checked my CAC score. I assume I am good, no symptoms of bad plaque build up. Have done carnivore from 1 year 6 months so I assume it is fine.

[00:34:52 / 2024-03-27 03:01:59 UTC] [MSG] @LittleIAO: @Darvit Nu I ask because my stepfather has this condition and he has been told he MUST stay away from fats. He is warned that the fats will cause pancreatic attacks.
[00:34:59 / 2024-03-27 03:02:06 UTC] [MSG] @adelarsen9776: @yehedmad Probably not but you could cut it out and see.

[00:35:32 / 2024-03-27 03:02:39 UTC] [MSG] @KoppersKitchen: @DS111 Yes, if you cook them slow like that it avoids that 'line'

[00:36:35 / 2024-03-27 03:03:42 UTC] [MSG] @JtxCarnivore: Ade Larsen- good job! Glad you fired the vegan doc if they won’t be open and supportive to carnivore!

[00:37:09 / 2024-03-27 03:04:16 UTC] [MSG] @Darvit_Nu: @Rezial unfortunately most physicians are still fat phobic. They don't realize we need animal fat to produce proper hormones, including leptin, insulin, etc. I'd start with small amounts & increase

[00:54:56 / 2024-03-27 03:22:03 UTC] [MSG] @adelarsen9776: @Andre Leite da Silva Galdino Perhaps eat more fat and perhaps some resistance training. Also moving in the sun can help.
[00:55:15 / 2024-03-27 03:22:22 UTC] [MSG] @KoppersKitchen: @K Z If you have already seen the Dr you can probably just call and ask

[00:57:48 / 2024-03-27 03:24:55 UTC] [MSG] @adelarsen9776: @K Z Yes and I still do. It's simply because the middle ear is slightly inflamed and swollen which makes the hole smaller so hearing is not as good.

[01:00:53 / 2024-03-27 03:28:00 UTC] [MSG] @adelarsen9776: @Andre Leite da Silva Galdino The healing process is done by the body in stages. Time periods of nothing happening is actually your body healing. So don't give up. This has been my exprience.

[01:05:04 / 2024-03-27 03:32:11 UTC] [MSG] @adelarsen9776: @zonygoose Never seek a permanent solution to a temporary problem. Perhaps go for a walk, drink water, eat fatty red meat and keep going.
[01:05:06 / 2024-03-27 03:32:13 UTC] [MSG] @AndreLeitedaSilvaGaldino: Kopper's Carnivore Kitchen So i just keep fat but eating meat? Why? Maybe the Carnivore diet don work when you are health. Becase this makes no sense
[01:05:24 / 2024-03-27 03:32:31 UTC] [MSG] @Darvit_Nu: @Drew Fuerstenberger Dr.C often talks to people with CKD in lives. He swears that eating fatty meat can improve kidney function. It reduces inflammation better than any other diet I know of, even keto

[01:05:54 / 2024-03-27 03:33:01 UTC] [MSG] @AndreLeitedaSilvaGaldino: DS111 I buy chuck and neck steak. Also eat whole eggs for the aditional fat. However i have not lost weight for most of the 120 days i have been eating this way

[01:12:15 / 2024-03-27 03:39:22 UTC] [MSG] @Darvit_Nu: @Sue Crickmore butter is considered a fat. Dairy is allowed on carnivore as more of a condiment as long as you are not sensitive to dairy.
