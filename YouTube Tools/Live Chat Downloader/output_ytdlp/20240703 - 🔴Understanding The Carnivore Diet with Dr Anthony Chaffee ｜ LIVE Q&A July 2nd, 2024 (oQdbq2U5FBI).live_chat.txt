[01:28:18 / 2024-07-03 04:00:26 UTC] [MSG] @Darvit_Nu: @Strange Things Happen electrolytes are only magnesium, potassium and sodium. There should be no sugar or carbs in electrolytes. I refer to them as "iums".

[01:55:29 / 2024-07-03 04:27:37 UTC] [MSG] @punchkitten874: Cured RA with carnivore. Some symptoms take longer, in weird spots. After one year, still occasionally odd pains, most healed. Two years plus, about same
[01:55:33 / 2024-07-03 04:27:41 UTC] [MSG] @TuromirCarnivore: ok past 18 months I have lost 12 kg in general
[01:55:47 / 2024-07-03 04:27:55 UTC] [MSG] @Darvit_Nu: @Nadja RA is an inflammatory condition & carnivore is antiinflammatory especially if you limit or avoid pork & chicken (high omega 6 & inflammatory) it should continue to improve 🙂 
[01:55:51 / 2024-07-03 04:27:58 UTC] [MSG] @adelarsen9776: @Theanimal3 Actually it turns out that there is no much difference.
[01:55:54 / 2024-07-03 04:28:01 UTC] [MSG] @KoppersKitchen: @Punch Kitten Thank you for sharing that!!
[01:56:21 / 2024-07-03 04:28:29 UTC] [MSG] @Rihla_a-z: the only thing that sets me back is when I have my period, the pain is intolerable, and I have to keep taking ibuprofen every 4/6 hours for 2 days in a row
[01:56:23 / 2024-07-03 04:28:30 UTC] [MSG] @theanimal3262: Thanks!!!
[01:56:32 / 2024-07-03 04:28:40 UTC] [MSG] @adelarsen9776: @Turomir Great news. Congratulations. Well done, keep going.
[01:56:44 / 2024-07-03 04:28:52 UTC] [MSG] @TuromirCarnivore: but my weight loss has stalled temporarily and I have extra skin around the waist and belly

[01:56:50 / 2024-07-03 04:28:57 UTC] [MSG] @brookgraves368: @KoppersCarnivore, I also noticed Dr Rob Cywes had helpful information for T1D.
[01:56:53 / 2024-07-03 04:29:01 UTC] [MSG] @Effin_the_Chat: The idea of cancer being a metabolic disease is fascinating. If true, it could mean that everyone can avoid it.
[01:56:55 / 2024-07-03 04:29:02 UTC] [MSG] @CosmicJestar: @Nadja adding a couple of longer fasts helped greatly: 5-7 days

[01:58:20 / 2024-07-03 04:30:28 UTC] [MSG] @adelarsen9776: @Nick Sheesen I eat my steak blue and my eggs soft but the studies show that minerals do not change and vitamins are only denatured 10% which is close to zero. It's not worth worrying about.
[01:58:23 / 2024-07-03 04:30:31 UTC] [MSG] @ObviouslyPatty: I used to be grossed out by any pink in a steak, but now I love it on the rare side
[01:58:32 / 2024-07-03 04:30:39 UTC] [MSG] @adelarsen9776: @Effin the Chat I do my best.
[01:58:48 / 2024-07-03 04:30:55 UTC] [MSG] @brookgraves368: @KoppetsCarnivore, I’ll do a search for Prof Bickman for T1D. I did not know that.
[01:58:50 / 2024-07-03 04:30:58 UTC] [MSG] @Darvit_Nu: Surgeon told me back in 2007 that my nerves would probably never regrow around my ribs. I'd have to be careful for the rest of my life. On carnivore, the nerves regrew! So much is possible ... 
[01:59:01 / 2024-07-03 04:31:08 UTC] [MSG] @NickSheesenYT: Ade, it's the protein not the minerals 👍
[01:59:04 / 2024-07-03 04:31:11 UTC] [MSG] @KoppersKitchen: @Patty Isnt it interesting how our tastes change too!
[01:59:06 / 2024-07-03 04:31:14 UTC] [MSG] @RosalindChaffee: @Turomir I know weight loss is the easiest thing to measure when doing carnivore, but sometimes things slow down as other parts of our bodies heal. Be patient and try to keep track other health stuff
[01:59:08 / 2024-07-03 04:31:15 UTC] [MSG] @theanimal3262: Thank you @ade!
[01:59:21 / 2024-07-03 04:31:29 UTC] [MSG] @adelarsen9776: @Darvit Nu That's the B vitamins in carnivore which did that.

[02:00:25 / 2024-07-03 04:32:33 UTC] [MSG] @adelarsen9776: @Nick Sheesen The nutrients don't change much. Just don't eat burnt steak.
[02:00:29 / 2024-07-03 04:32:37 UTC] [MSG] @Darvit_Nu: @Ade Larsen I believe that 100%.. my B vitamins used to be low & I used to get anemia easily. The steaks reversed all of that 😍

[02:02:20 / 2024-07-03 04:34:28 UTC] [MSG] @adelarsen9776: @Effin the Chat I had bad gout in each ankle every 2 months for 12 months. Bad oxalate dumping.
[02:02:32 / 2024-07-03 04:34:39 UTC] [MSG] @nadja8620: @Rosalind I ate a piece of 100% chocolate once in a while to slow it down. Helped almost immediately. Totally crazy
[02:02:39 / 2024-07-03 04:34:46 UTC] [MSG] @NickSheesenYT: Ade, yes if you use the water after, frying is the way for me

[02:02:53 / 2024-07-03 04:35:00 UTC] [MSG] @Darvit_Nu: @Nadja Glad to hear you're doing better! Doc says it isn't necessary to force fasting.. just eat when you're hungry until it tastes like cardboard. drink water when thirsty. this woe heals! 🙂
[02:02:57 / 2024-07-03 04:35:05 UTC] [MSG] @RosalindChaffee: @Nadja I'm glad it helped

[02:05:06 / 2024-07-03 04:37:14 UTC] [MSG] @adelarsen9776: @Lolita sila Maybe you are not hungry and don't need the nutrients ? Try eating less.
[02:05:10 / 2024-07-03 04:37:18 UTC] [MSG] @Darvit_Nu: @A PEACEFUL WOLF RETIREMENT the surgery was in 2007, by the end of 2008 I was fully healed but ribs were numb. When I went lion this year with Doc, the nerves regrew! 16 years post op! There's hope!

[02:05:55 / 2024-07-03 04:38:03 UTC] [MSG] @Effin_the_Chat: @Ade LarsenI know when it's happening, because my ankle will start to hurt. I sprained it while hiking, and now I roll it randomly. It never hurt until I went carnivore.
[02:05:55 / 2024-07-03 04:38:03 UTC] [MSG] @adelarsen9776: @Justjen Eat when you are hungry but make sure you are actually hungry and not just for habit.

[02:06:35 / 2024-07-03 04:38:43 UTC] [MSG] @adelarsen9776: @Effin the Chat Same with me. I did not have gout until I went carnivore. That's when the oxalate dumping started.
[02:06:46 / 2024-07-03 04:38:54 UTC] [MSG] @Darvit_Nu: @Justjen anytime! that's what we're here for 😉 Especially important in the beginning to feed your body to get the good nutrition!
[02:07:02 / 2024-07-03 04:39:10 UTC] [MSG] @SeatoSky1111: @Ade Larsen ~ makes sense. My issue is I have been beginning my eating later in day and then not hungry til 8 or 9 pm . I need to get back on a normal circadian schedule and eat earlier.

[02:12:02 / 2024-07-03 04:44:09 UTC] [MSG] @Darvit_Nu: @Justjen Yes! the conditions make it more of a challenge but I have a lot of faith it'll help because the circulation improves so much on carnivore plus the nutrients... I keep hoping for you!
[02:12:26 / 2024-07-03 04:44:33 UTC] [MSG] @adelarsen9776: @Justjen You're welcome. Dr Max Gulhane MD is a great source of this subject and carnivore diet.

[02:14:12 / 2024-07-03 04:46:19 UTC] [MSG] @Effin_the_Chat: People who care about other people and want to feed them are like, "eat. Eat." Then you have to explain to them how you're either not hungry, or you're a carnivore. And then they think you're weird.
[02:14:12 / 2024-07-03 04:46:20 UTC] [MSG] @edisontwain8238: I´ve been trying to be carnivore for a year now but i always come back to eating carbs, any advise?

[02:15:38 / 2024-07-03 04:47:45 UTC] [MSG] @Darvit_Nu: @Justjen that is a very real thing! Most of us experience heightened senses of smell & taste. Our tastes often change too. Helping here is something I truly love to do! The health returns are worthit
[02:15:53 / 2024-07-03 04:48:00 UTC] [MSG] @punchkitten874: Edison, keep bacon in your pocket
[02:15:54 / 2024-07-03 04:48:01 UTC] [MSG] @adelarsen9776: @Dani Meat does not cause colon cancer.
[02:15:59 / 2024-07-03 04:48:07 UTC] [MSG] @lorihelmuth6587: Of course I’m not smothering it with bbq sauce. Just want beef lately.

[02:16:18 / 2024-07-03 04:48:25 UTC] [MSG] @RosalindChaffee: @Dani he's said a lot about it - basically that this is not the case when you're not also eating plants and also don't burn your meat.
[02:16:19 / 2024-07-03 04:48:26 UTC] [MSG] @DS111-b8b: I see guys at my job in construction -- come 10:30 a.m. they get ravenously hungry. Sometimes, when they return, then some have an urgent bowel movement situation. Ridiculous...
[02:16:19 / 2024-07-03 04:48:27 UTC] [MSG] @teamna1: This must be said, “ Life’s too short to eat chicken.” #BEEF !
[02:16:35 / 2024-07-03 04:48:42 UTC] [MSG] @adelarsen9776: @Lori Helmuth Fatty beef, salt and water is proper human food.

[02:17:26 / 2024-07-03 04:49:33 UTC] [MSG] @SilverJ56: This way of life has very little negative effects. People just need to dial their individual needs in... If you're a real Carnivore, you'll have the brain power to research it!!
[02:17:34 / 2024-07-03 04:49:42 UTC] [MSG] @KoppersKitchen: @Justjen Thank you for being here!!
