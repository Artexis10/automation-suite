[01:06:22 / 2024-02-09 02:14:45 UTC] [MSG] @Darvit_Nu: @Rajaram Jeyashankar your body is most likely trying to balance blood pressure. Having lower blood pressure reduces ❤risk. It takes time to adjust. Move slowly to allow pressure to come back up.
[01:06:33 / 2024-02-09 02:14:57 UTC] [MSG] @KoppersKitchen: @Gina Kuichou what oil are you eating?
[01:06:48 / 2024-02-09 02:15:12 UTC] [MSG] @scoobydadog246: Combo w/ that @Darvit Nu, & my %body fat is already low. my body is resistant to ketosis, & turning my protein into glucose for energy b/c I'm not absorbing a lot of fat I'm eating, it's in toilet

[01:11:10 / 2024-02-09 02:19:34 UTC] [MSG] @Darvit_Nu: @ScoobyDaDog have you tried the cold fat? I don't know how the MCT oil would react since it is liquid coconut oil. It can cause diarrhea. Why do you believe you are not in ketosis.
[01:11:14 / 2024-02-09 02:19:37 UTC] [MSG] @chargermopar: I never got tired of meat

[01:12:17 / 2024-02-09 02:20:40 UTC] [MSG] @scoobydadog246: @Darvit Nu I don't know for sure, but it's my theory 1. b/c despite eating more meat & fat, I don't stay in ketosis 2.don't feel good. but crappy, ? b/c not using fat well for energy or glucose.

[01:14:41 / 2024-02-09 02:23:05 UTC] [MSG] @Darvit_Nu: I'd look into some testing if at all possible. Even T1D do really well on carnivore. If you've been eating strict carnivore for awhile, the only other thing I can suggest is try iodine. Some need it.
[01:14:44 / 2024-02-09 02:23:07 UTC] [MSG] @scoobydadog246: So far @Darvit Nu increasing MCT has not made that worse, my new theory is to go back to more liquid, b/c it is already emulsifed (bile). I'll let you know 🙂 
[01:15:01 / 2024-02-09 02:23:24 UTC] [MSG] @KoppersKitchen: @Farahnaz888 You are probably detoxing
[01:15:20 / 2024-02-09 02:23:43 UTC] [MSG] @williammccartney4833: milk is like the trap house.
[01:15:20 / 2024-02-09 02:23:43 UTC] [MSG] @SvetlanaVladimirova8590: @Farahnaz888 How long have you been carnivore?
[01:15:24 / 2024-02-09 02:23:48 UTC] [MSG] @Lamz..: @CAYDENCE* Sugars will do that, and seed oils. These are the ones causing inflammation in your body.
[01:15:31 / 2024-02-09 02:23:54 UTC] [MSG] @Darvit_Nu: Yes, @ScoobyDaDog do keep us posted. I'm curious to see what works for you. 
[01:15:32 / 2024-02-09 02:23:55 UTC] [MSG] @denisea.9033: I only started drinking milk after becoming mostly meat based. I think because it’s the only sweet thing
[01:15:40 / 2024-02-09 02:24:03 UTC] [MSG] @ancient1350: Raw milk tastes tooo good
[01:15:48 / 2024-02-09 02:24:11 UTC] [MSG] @farahnaz8885: It’s been 6 months I am having puffy eyes

[01:15:57 / 2024-02-09 02:24:21 UTC] [MSG] @KoppersKitchen: I would not be able to drink a single glass so I have to stay away

[01:16:22 / 2024-02-09 02:24:46 UTC] [MSG] @SvetlanaVladimirova8590: @Farahnaz888 Do you drink coffee, milk? 
[01:16:34 / 2024-02-09 02:24:57 UTC] [MSG] @farahnaz8885: No 
[01:16:45 / 2024-02-09 02:25:09 UTC] [MSG] @KoppersKitchen: @Gina Kuichou Two days is not enough to tell anything. If you follow the plan you will see results. If it feels like too much fat to start then cut back
[01:16:48 / 2024-02-09 02:25:11 UTC] [MSG] @Darvit_Nu: I don't eat any iodine foods & have a genetic condition that causes issues so I do supplement with iodine & now I can work all day with boundless energy, no anemia either.
[01:16:58 / 2024-02-09 02:25:21 UTC] [MSG] @rajaramjeyashankar4385: @Darvit Nu Thank you. but, i am good when i take carbs
