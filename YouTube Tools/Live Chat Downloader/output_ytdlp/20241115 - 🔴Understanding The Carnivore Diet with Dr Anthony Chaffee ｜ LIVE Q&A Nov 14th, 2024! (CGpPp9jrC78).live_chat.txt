[01:45:37 / 2024-11-15 03:22:08 UTC] [MSG] @andyc7747: Yes, Adding some oxalate should prevent the dumping symptoms if that is the case
[01:45:37 / 2024-11-15 03:22:08 UTC] [MSG] @supplementallychallenged: I can’t promise about the happy part. 😅
[01:45:55 / 2024-11-15 03:22:26 UTC] [MSG] @loriwilson-n9t: I read that coffee is good for the liver
