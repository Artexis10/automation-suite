[00:12:07 / 2024-03-15 03:39:29 UTC] [MSG] @Darvit_Nu: We often need to heal our bodies & balance all of our hormones before the extra weight starts getting burned off. Long term carnivores I know all tell me to stick it out for the long haul like 5 years

[00:13:43 / 2024-03-15 03:41:05 UTC] [MSG] @RosalindChaffee: @Kopper's Carnivore Kitchen - is that the new hat or the one that the monkey got when he was in bali... if it's the new one we may need to get him a black cap

[00:13:56 / 2024-03-15 03:41:18 UTC] [MSG] @Darvit_Nu: The increased hair fall is temporary & it will grow back in healthier. Just make sure you're eating enough fat & protein to protect your body from extra stress.

[00:14:59 / 2024-03-15 03:42:21 UTC] [MSG] @adelarsen9776: @chargermopar (Rick) That's because our gut biome immune system was set in the first 6 weeks of life and we got plenty of the right bacteria from mother and the environment in that time.
[00:15:03 / 2024-03-15 03:42:25 UTC] [MSG] @Elle_Marie_: Someone requested that he wear this hair for the live

[00:15:44 / 2024-03-15 03:43:06 UTC] [MSG] @chargermopar: My parents often warned me that eating duck eggs was unsafe

[00:16:01 / 2024-03-15 03:43:23 UTC] [MSG] @Darvit_Nu: @Slady often healing from metabolic damage or stresses on the body, overworked adrenals are often a major contributor & upping the animal fats often helps. 70% to 75% or 80% fat for example
[00:16:12 / 2024-03-15 03:43:34 UTC] [MSG] @KoppersKitchen: @Ade Larsen Very well said!

[00:18:26 / 2024-03-15 03:45:48 UTC] [MSG] @Darvit_Nu: @Slady it usually only happens if someone's body is stressed too much (over exercising & under eating) Your body will drop hair to use the little food for body function. Eating enough helps prevent it

[00:30:02 / 2024-03-15 03:57:24 UTC] [MSG] @suew4609: @RobMcG This is true for many, but not all. I dove right in and suffered from oxalate dumping. Backed up and went slow. 7 weeks I think I can now go full Carnivore. Slowly up fat and decrease carbs.
[00:30:39 / 2024-03-15 03:58:01 UTC] [MSG] @LosingDrea: one of her Dr's told me it's not re amended I restrict the diet of the elderly yet my restrictive recommendations is certainly not what landed her here.
[00:30:41 / 2024-03-15 03:58:02 UTC] [MSG] @KoppersKitchen: @Eric Michaels YVW! Dr. will have a great interview out soon with a veterinarian!

[00:30:53 / 2024-03-15 03:58:15 UTC] [MSG] @adelarsen9776: Note : Sometimes yellow fat on beef can mean the animal was sick. But usually it indicates grass fed conditions.
[00:31:13 / 2024-03-15 03:58:35 UTC] [MSG] @RosalindChaffee: @LosingDrea there are a couple of senior facilities in arizona where the person running them has been moving patients to keto and carnivore when possible. If they don't listen to you they might to him
[00:31:17 / 2024-03-15 03:58:39 UTC] [MSG] @Darvit_Nu: Gradual transition is better! I went cold turkey and those first 3 days 😵😵‍💫 transitioning helps avoid the nasty headaches, rashes, etc.

[00:31:30 / 2024-03-15 03:58:52 UTC] [MSG] @ASpectacular3777: How do we know if it is grass-finished? I’ve never seen that on a label; at least not here around Chicago
[00:31:36 / 2024-03-15 03:58:58 UTC] [MSG] @Benedict00_MankoMuncher: I'm 9 days in to carnivore.. feeling healthy physically. But mentally I'm not doing too good. I dread eating and nothing tastes good. no coffee just meat and water.

[00:32:42 / 2024-03-15 04:00:03 UTC] [MSG] @LosingDrea: @Rosilanand she has been in remission from stage 4 small cell lung cancer, but they gave her sucrose iron infusions, 6 of them starting 2 a week Nov 7th, 14, etc..and she quickly defined cognitively
[00:32:56 / 2024-03-15 04:00:18 UTC] [MSG] @RosalindChaffee: oh dear! 
[00:33:27 / 2024-03-15 04:00:49 UTC] [MSG] @Darvit_Nu: @Benedict it happens! Just take it slow. If you don't feel like eating, stay hydrated & fast a little until your appetite picks back up. You may just need to flush some toxins out or adjust. 
[00:33:36 / 2024-03-15 04:00:58 UTC] [MSG] @808bear2: @Kopper's Carnivore Kitchen g'day
[00:33:43 / 2024-03-15 04:01:05 UTC] [MSG] @RosalindChaffee: well she needs the iron and the lesion is likely the cause of the cognitive decline but yes - I agree it would be helpful to put her on at least keto
[00:34:08 / 2024-03-15 04:01:30 UTC] [MSG] @chargermopar: Lard and baking soda for teeth
[00:34:13 / 2024-03-15 04:01:35 UTC] [MSG] @808bear2: Coconut oil does taste good to be honest.
[00:34:22 / 2024-03-15 04:01:44 UTC] [MSG] @KoppersKitchen: @808Bear Hey there!
[00:34:32 / 2024-03-15 04:01:54 UTC] [MSG] @suew4609: Coconut oil is used to help teeth and gums, I don’t think it whitens teeth.

[00:35:03 / 2024-03-15 04:02:25 UTC] [MSG] @mopHEADkryssy: Yes, I, too, use baking soda for my teeth. Super white!
[00:35:29 / 2024-03-15 04:02:50 UTC] [MSG] @LosingDrea: I witnessed the desalination of her anions and extreme hunger caused her to eat
[00:35:35 / 2024-03-15 04:02:57 UTC] [MSG] @808bear2: @chargermopar (Rick) to save money when I wash my clothes I go 50% laundry powder & 50% Bicarb.
[00:35:37 / 2024-03-15 04:02:59 UTC] [MSG] @Benedict00_MankoMuncher: @darvit I'm trying ..I maybe made a mistake and decided to skip p90x also so I really need the protein. every day I fight the urge to quit even though my mental health isn't doing great

[00:36:39 / 2024-03-15 04:04:01 UTC] [MSG] @Darvit_Nu: @TKM7211 you can get the same results with any animal fat & baking soda. The saturated animal fat is anti-inflammatory & bacterial resistance improves dental health immensely!
[00:37:03 / 2024-03-15 04:04:25 UTC] [MSG] @KoppersKitchen: @RichiGuru If you can make your own you can control exactly what goes into it. 
[00:37:13 / 2024-03-15 04:04:35 UTC] [MSG] @LosingDrea: oatmeal, raisins, dried cranber6. prunes, I e cream. she was keto all through her chemo and radiation which was successful in putting the lung cancer at rest but cancer could have come back but

[00:38:00 / 2024-03-15 04:05:22 UTC] [MSG] @Darvit_Nu: He's absolutely right! I've not had many dislocations since going 100% carnivore! I eat the connective tissues, meat & fat. Even my appetite is better. 
[00:38:19 / 2024-03-15 04:05:41 UTC] [MSG] @LosingDrea: Oh, it's after midnight. I'm just waiting to find out what time they're gonna come and take her to do stereotactic, brain biopsy, which in itself has risks we need to know what it is

[00:38:46 / 2024-03-15 04:06:08 UTC] [MSG] @808bear2: I watched a youtube short where it showed a once loved ice cream is no longer considered an ice cream. It was written on the box but people are being duped IMO.

[00:39:54 / 2024-03-15 04:07:16 UTC] [MSG] @Darvit_Nu: @Rosalind it's crazy how much healing has occurred in just 90 days of being strict! I'm beyond glad I decided to try it & now I'm like ... Why would I want to add any of that inflammatory crap back?!

[00:41:11 / 2024-03-15 04:08:33 UTC] [MSG] @LosingDrea: I get looked at cra y for the suggestions I've made for her diet. Name dropped Dr. Chaffee and others and here in Macon GA were alone on our beliefs
[00:41:12 / 2024-03-15 04:08:34 UTC] [MSG] @808bear2: for clarity it was written on the box it was a "frozen treat" not ice cream. Ice cream has a fat content to be measured.
[00:41:23 / 2024-03-15 04:08:45 UTC] [MSG] @MystryArt: His interview with dr. Rob cywes mentioned a couple great books and studies.

[00:42:39 / 2024-03-15 04:10:01 UTC] [MSG] @Darvit_Nu: @LosingDrea that's why I recommend this community so often. We all need a community or people who understand & are like-minded for support. We're glad you're here!

[00:42:54 / 2024-03-15 04:10:16 UTC] [MSG] @LosingDrea: my husband and I are all she has and we have to keep our cool and trust their ways even when we believe from our own experiences in a better way.
[00:42:58 / 2024-03-15 04:10:20 UTC] [MSG] @RosalindChaffee: @KK sorry - he sometimes talks about the history of foods and books on that topic so I was confused
[00:42:59 / 2024-03-15 04:10:21 UTC] [MSG] @KK-lg8uz: im particularly interested in what we know about the evolution of nutrition

[00:44:30 / 2024-03-15 04:11:52 UTC] [MSG] @Darvit_Nu: @Rosalind omg I know! it's crazy when we get a taste of what our lives used to feel like! Pain is a very good reminder, unfortunately.. but it keeps us on the right path! I'm staying carnivore lol

[01:25:15 / 2024-03-15 04:52:37 UTC] [MSG] @RosalindChaffee: @LosingDrea rest while you can. I've spent a lot of time in the hospital with my dad in the past few years. It's hard and awful and remember to care for yourself too.

[02:13:00 / 2024-03-15 05:40:22 UTC] [MSG] @Martin_Neal: @Tina Andre . Ketosis is the usual metabolic pathway. It is almost entirely fat conversion; very little protein is used for fuel. Rather protein is used to build and repair cells and organs/tissues.

[02:14:32 / 2024-03-15 05:41:54 UTC] [MSG] @Martin_Neal: @Tina Andre . Carnivore Diet does not have being constantly in ketosis as a goal or an ideal. It tends to be ketogenic bc it low-carb.
