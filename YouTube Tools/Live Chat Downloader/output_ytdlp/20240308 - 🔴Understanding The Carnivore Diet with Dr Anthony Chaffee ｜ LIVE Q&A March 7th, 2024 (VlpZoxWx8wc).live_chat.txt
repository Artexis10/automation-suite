[00:11:19 / 2024-03-08 01:23:37 UTC] [MSG] @Darvit_Nu: @Sandra yes! you should feel a lot better after 3 days of no coffee. It's a diuretic so it increases the water in the colon & bowel causing issues. I hope you feel better soon!!! 
[00:11:39 / 2024-03-08 01:23:57 UTC] [MSG] @therealdeal3672: gut suffering was one of the main reasons I went carnivore

[00:20:18 / 2024-03-08 01:32:36 UTC] [MSG] @Darvit_Nu: @PJ Equine Lady I had one in my thumb but now I have several. It's a concern because the nails sometimes peel or split along the ridge! I need to get it to stop doing that but am unsure of the cause.
[00:20:24 / 2024-03-08 01:32:41 UTC] [MSG] @mopHEADkryssy: @Sandra Please stay in the group and keep us updated. It helps to have a community of people who are doing what you are doing. 👍 God bless!

[00:22:21 / 2024-03-08 01:34:39 UTC] [MSG] @Darvit_Nu: @Kristina Dunn it could be inflammation you're still flushing out. Carnivore is naturally diuretic. The water you drink isn't stored so much in the tissues anymore. Better flushing of toxins too. 
[00:22:28 / 2024-03-08 01:34:46 UTC] [MSG] @JtxCarnivore: Hi Dr. Kiltz! ☺👋🏻

[01:57:38 / 2024-03-08 03:09:56 UTC] [MSG] @tommy10001: @Rosalind that is fair -- although I wouldn't say Kefir is *very* low in carbs, it's like 10g carbs per serving and I have like 3-4 servings per day
[01:57:44 / 2024-03-08 03:10:02 UTC] [MSG] @KoppersKitchen: @Alvin Kim Pork is not optimal to a ruminant BUT pork is perfectly fine if you do not have any issues with it. Some people have issues with pork
[01:58:18 / 2024-03-08 03:10:36 UTC] [MSG] @RosalindChaffee: @T K as long as it's working for your body that is the primary criteria 
[01:58:18 / 2024-03-08 03:10:36 UTC] [MSG] @KristenGlover-c1d: @Anthony Chaffee MD thank you so much for all the great info!! Good night everyone!!!

[01:59:14 / 2024-03-08 03:11:32 UTC] [MSG] @dmakk861: get as clean of cured pork as you can. I eat 4-5 pounds bacon a week with my steaks. I even put bacon in my burger cookies
[01:59:14 / 2024-03-08 03:11:32 UTC] [MSG] @alvinkim1305: i guess im buying both then just to see the difference. Alright love you people!
[02:00:19 / 2024-03-08 03:12:36 UTC] [MSG] @KoppersKitchen: @Alvin Kim That is a great idea, keep a journal as well. You may have no issues with pork at all. I eat pork often, but cannot eat chicken. It all depends on the individual
[02:00:29 / 2024-03-08 03:12:47 UTC] [MSG] @RosalindChaffee: @T K lololol lets tell him I'm the boss he will laugh so hard (older sister laugh here)🤣🤣🤣

[02:00:48 / 2024-03-08 03:13:06 UTC] [MSG] @Darvit_Nu: The kefir they sell here is all low fat! I want to start making some yogurt & might try kefir too so I can get full fat & no sugar or additives & pasturized (killing the active cultures!)

[02:12:42 / 2024-03-08 03:25:00 UTC] [MSG] @Darvit_Nu: @The Real Deal it's really hard to get a cat to eat something they don't want or need. I fed mine 80/20 & he did just fine. I also fed him fish, raw liver & egg yolks. If he left food he was full. 🙂 
[02:12:59 / 2024-03-08 03:25:17 UTC] [MSG] @scoobydadog246: I just made my first ribeye tonight!!🤣😂

[02:14:58 / 2024-03-08 03:27:16 UTC] [MSG] @scoobydadog246: @Darvit Nu Not bad! I'm sure not great by most standards, but it's really good! I shared a little with the doggie. she loves it too.! Just seared in stainless pan, then cooked a little .. not bad!

[02:15:36 / 2024-03-08 03:27:54 UTC] [MSG] @therealdeal3672: Thank you @Darvit Nu I have 80/20 grass-fed beef patties that I could thaw as a start. I think I'll start slowly.
[02:15:55 / 2024-03-08 03:28:12 UTC] [MSG] @KoppersKitchen: @Christopher Thompson WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN! ;-)
[02:15:55 / 2024-03-08 03:28:12 UTC] [MSG] @Darvit_Nu: @ScoobyDaDog I find different cuts of meat even from the same animal have completely different tastes & textures.

[02:16:51 / 2024-03-08 03:29:09 UTC] [MSG] @scoobydadog246: Interesting @Darvit Nu I am just starting my exploration. I've been mostly ground beef b/c it's easy on my gut. but expanding out a bit! 
[02:16:53 / 2024-03-08 03:29:10 UTC] [MSG] @Darvit_Nu: @The Real Deal slow transition is a good idea! you can put a few bits in with what's familiar to give the clue that it's okay to eat it. 
[02:17:03 / 2024-03-08 03:29:20 UTC] [MSG] @MeatAndMusic: I do recommend that, everyone on this Carnivore Lifestyle, at least once, have a Tomahawk steak....
