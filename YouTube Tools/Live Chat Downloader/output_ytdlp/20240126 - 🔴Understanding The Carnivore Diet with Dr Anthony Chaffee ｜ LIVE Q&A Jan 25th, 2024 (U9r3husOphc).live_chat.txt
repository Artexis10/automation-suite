[01:51:42 / 2024-01-26 03:16:24 UTC] [MSG] @Fred82ndAbn: Watch pork rind brands. Many use veg oil to cook the rinds instead of rendered fat
[01:51:54 / 2024-01-26 03:16:37 UTC] [MSG] @iloveseaglass: Pork rinds I think have seed oils. They dont have to include them if they just process the rinds in it. I have called some of the company’s and found out seed oils!!!! 😡

[01:52:37 / 2024-01-26 03:17:19 UTC] [MSG] @Martin_Neal: @Nireekshana . Any and every human, regardless of race, can (and should) eat a hyper-carnivore diet. 'Indians' are not an exception to this rule.

[01:53:01 / 2024-01-26 03:17:43 UTC] [MSG] @welshboyuk7651: I don’t have a mason jar to store fat when I’ve cooked so can I just put it in a plastic cup with a lid on?
[01:53:17 / 2024-01-26 03:17:59 UTC] [MSG] @SaltyCracker88: wish I had a cool social group to talk and learn more about carnivore. everyone I know is either all American or they just like throwing hella "tasty" crap on everything.
[01:53:36 / 2024-01-26 03:18:18 UTC] [MSG] @grunklebob2021: I would never eat peanut oil pork rinds

[01:54:03 / 2024-01-26 03:18:45 UTC] [MSG] @Fred82ndAbn: @Mike Pullman bacon may be cured with sugar, it may have other nasty stuff depending on the brand. Get one as pure as possible and with little carbs as posible. You can also buy pork belly & make own
[01:54:05 / 2024-01-26 03:18:47 UTC] [MSG] @guitarguyjoefry: They are kind of mean to new people asking questions. So I left the group

[01:54:41 / 2024-01-26 03:19:23 UTC] [MSG] @Darvit_Nu: @Mike Pullman check out "go carnivore app" see if that's something that might be what you're looking for 🙂

[02:14:36 / 2024-01-26 03:39:18 UTC] [MSG] @Darvit_Nu: @Alex Andra I wouldn't worry too much unless you start experiencing symptoms of low thyroid. If you get symptoms you could add some iodine and it would help support your thyroid.

[02:28:54 / 2024-01-26 03:53:36 UTC] [MSG] @Darvit_Nu: @Trevor Dunwoody yes you sure can. If it doesn't bother you it's perfectly fine. It's fermented dairy which is more digestible.
[02:29:00 / 2024-01-26 03:53:42 UTC] [MSG] @Stephm3678: they won't be able to deny the results they see!
