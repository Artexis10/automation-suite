[00:23:42 / 2024-03-06 02:38:40 UTC] [MSG] @chargermopar: I am an extreme example, I can eat a LOT of fat sometimes 1 pound at a meal.
[00:23:59 / 2024-03-06 02:38:57 UTC] [MSG] @chargermopar: Any food with sugar should be avoided

[00:24:42 / 2024-03-06 02:39:40 UTC] [MSG] @KoppersKitchen: @bill Cooke If you can tolerate it
[00:24:44 / 2024-03-06 02:39:42 UTC] [MSG] @Darvit_Nu: @Kristen Glover ditch the sugar first, then gradually reduce the other foods while increasing the meat & fat you eat until you're transitioned to full carnivore. Gradual is better to avoid ketoflu

[00:25:29 / 2024-03-06 02:40:26 UTC] [MSG] @Christ_in_Christy: @Morax Sometimes people ask about how do i gain weight? And he says to add in some carbs. But your weight should level out eventually in carnivore. If you gain fat, dial back carbs. Lift heavy, though
[00:25:32 / 2024-03-06 02:40:30 UTC] [MSG] @chargermopar: Yes I never experienced the keto flu\
[00:25:45 / 2024-03-06 02:40:43 UTC] [MSG] @scoobydadog246:  @bill Cooke it would depend on who you ask, but technically cheese is an animal product 🙂 You can find a brand without added sugar or other crap. There is one called Good Culture.

[00:28:38 / 2024-03-06 02:43:36 UTC] [MSG] @Darvit_Nu: @Staggs it's better to use a tape measure. The scale is only what you weigh not what the weight is made of. You could be gaining lean mass while burning extra fat. Monthly measurements will show it
[00:28:45 / 2024-03-06 02:43:43 UTC] [MSG] @CalmCowBell: Kopper I cannot imagaine that is good for my gut, nor absorbable

[00:29:46 / 2024-03-06 02:44:44 UTC] [MSG] @Christ_in_Christy: @Staggs how long have you been carnivore? Remember you will gain bone density. Are you losing inches, or clothes fitting looser? Are you fasting any?

[00:30:28 / 2024-03-06 02:45:26 UTC] [MSG] @Darvit_Nu: @Michele Purcell your insulin fluctuates during the day but over time your fasting insulin should lower & stay more steady than the highs & lows from a standard diet full of carbs. 
[00:30:38 / 2024-03-06 02:45:36 UTC] [MSG] @vinsanchez1066: Yes, how do you tag people..that’s nifty.

[00:36:08 / 2024-03-06 02:51:06 UTC] [MSG] @JtxCarnivore: Salmon bothers my stomach. Seems I do best on just beef. Think probably due to them fed corn and soy.

[01:12:12 / 2024-03-06 03:27:10 UTC] [MSG] @UN-gm2ur: @scooby @svg I'm hoping the current diet will put a stop to more plaque. There's so much pressure to take statins and switch to plant based, high fiber diet. my family blames carnivore. grrr

[01:14:53 / 2024-03-06 03:29:51 UTC] [MSG] @Darvit_Nu: Fruits, seeds, vegetables, plants, grains are all species specific foods for the animals that are meant to eat. Koalas eat eucalyptus but it's poisonous! .. not to them. 😇
[01:15:07 / 2024-03-06 03:30:05 UTC] [MSG] @scoobydadog246: @SVG we can't put links here - there is a man named Ivor Cummings, I've seen an interview on his channel of a man who had a protocol to reverse his CAC score quite a bit, using vitK2.something else..

[01:15:30 / 2024-03-06 03:30:28 UTC] [MSG] @Darvit_Nu: I'm glad @Kopper's Carnivore Kitchen! If they get enough complaints, maybe they'll be able to do something about it!

[02:12:59 / 2024-03-06 04:27:56 UTC] [MSG] @KoppersKitchen: @Anna Yes it is very normal, you might want to cut back on the fat a bit until you can balance your fat for your body

[02:23:16 / 2024-03-06 04:38:14 UTC] [MSG] @RosalindChaffee: @Chrissy with carnevore there isn't a competition so you make use of all the C that is available in meat, and it is entirely enough for the body. Carnivores do not get scurvy. I promise
