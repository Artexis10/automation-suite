[01:07:54 / 2024-10-04 02:56:18 UTC] [MSG] @Darvit_Nu: I think even if a huge wooly mammoth sat on Doc's lap that it wouldn't keep him still... he'd show up to work no matter what ... even if he had to ride the mammoth that was sitting on him. 🤦🏼‍♀

[01:09:55 / 2024-10-04 02:58:19 UTC] [MSG] @KoppersKitchen: Before blindly following anyone please do your own research. We are seeing more and more anecdotalinstances of individuals having major reactions to supplementing with iodine before being tested to 
[01:09:55 / 2024-10-04 02:58:20 UTC] [MSG] @KoppersKitchen: see if it is needed. For anyone to make a blanket statement that EVERY person is deficient in iodine, (or any other mineral or nutrient), is not only incorrect and misleading but it can be dangerous
[01:10:02 / 2024-10-04 02:58:27 UTC] [MSG] @RosalindChaffee: @Christen Elizabeth there are a lot of people who need iodine in this world. Sadly there really is such a thing as too high. I'm curious if these doctors are from the goiter belt.

[02:04:43 / 2024-10-04 03:53:08 UTC] [MSG] @Darvit_Nu: @Kopper's Carnivore Kitchen can we save @Mike Cayen's question for doc for the next live. I know what he's talking about but it is more medical than nutrition ... I'd like Dr.C's input on it. 🙏 
[02:04:44 / 2024-10-04 03:53:09 UTC] [MSG] @keepingitrealwithheidi: i took myself off metformin...all good🙏😊
[02:04:51 / 2024-10-04 03:53:15 UTC] [MSG] @mikecayen8580: QQQ: Dr Chaffee, carnivore for 1 year, ton of benefits, settled in at optimal weight, BP normalized, down 30 points BUT, I've started developing xanthelasmas in the corner of eyes. Why? They get ugly
[02:05:00 / 2024-10-04 03:53:25 UTC] [MSG] @OaktownGirl: @Viking Cat this is regarding raw eggs
[02:05:11 / 2024-10-04 03:53:35 UTC] [MSG] @vikingcat794: oh no
[02:05:15 / 2024-10-04 03:53:40 UTC] [MSG] @KoppersKitchen: @Darvit Nu I can put it in the notes now
[02:05:20 / 2024-10-04 03:53:45 UTC] [MSG] @chris_carnivore_calisthenics: @OaktownGirl I soft-boil my eggs most of the time to cook the whites enough, but keep the yolks liquidy.A little Redmond's on top of each before I eat the egg whole and, yum!I bought a Dash egg cooker
[02:05:50 / 2024-10-04 03:54:15 UTC] [MSG] @KoppersKitchen: @Darvit Nu It would be better if @Mike Cayen would come back and ask it, but i am sticking in for next week now 🙂
[02:06:16 / 2024-10-04 03:54:40 UTC] [MSG] @OaktownGirl: @Christopher Thompson I've been looking at those egg cooker! Sounds like you really like yours.
[02:06:19 / 2024-10-04 03:54:43 UTC] [MSG] @Darvit_Nu: @OaktownGirl I get that! Eggs don't even stay with me very long. They're the quickest transit protein to digest. what about taking along some pre-made beef jerky too to snack on? 
[02:06:26 / 2024-10-04 03:54:50 UTC] [MSG] @NickSheesenYT: CT, you've got it sorted, well done bro
[02:06:28 / 2024-10-04 03:54:53 UTC] [MSG] @michaelbare5380: yep, soft boiled eggs with Redmond's 🙂
[02:07:15 / 2024-10-04 03:55:40 UTC] [MSG] @Darvit_Nu: @Kopper's Carnivore Kitchen agreed! Thank you though!!! At least we'll have the question saved for a reminder 🙂 
[02:07:18 / 2024-10-04 03:55:43 UTC] [MSG] @OaktownGirl: @Darvit Nu thanks. I need to look into a jerky set up at home.
[02:07:19 / 2024-10-04 03:55:44 UTC] [MSG] @NickSheesenYT: eggs 🥚 and butter 🧈 for me, with sea salt flakes of course
[02:07:24 / 2024-10-04 03:55:49 UTC] [MSG] @williammccartney4833: good night Everyone!
[02:07:37 / 2024-10-04 03:56:01 UTC] [MSG] @kennethdow7075: If you're not eating real butter it will not process, and it will come out like diarrhea. And if you don't have your gallbladder you can't process a lot of butter.
[02:07:38 / 2024-10-04 03:56:03 UTC] [MSG] @KoppersKitchen: @William McCartney Night night

[02:08:25 / 2024-10-04 03:56:49 UTC] [MSG] @OaktownGirl: Time to do dishes, sigh. Take care everybody!
[02:08:29 / 2024-10-04 03:56:53 UTC] [MSG] @Vegansignguy: I love how we reflexively follow a guy like this ( like lemmings ) . Ugh … I’ll be making a video shortly on vegan kids and how they are objectively healthier. 
[02:08:31 / 2024-10-04 03:56:55 UTC] [MSG] @TheFeralGrandma: mmm, soft boiled or poached, I love them, but I won't be hungry for 13 or 14 hours
[02:08:35 / 2024-10-04 03:57:00 UTC] [MSG] @KoppersKitchen: Superchats are done for tonight

[02:09:51 / 2024-10-04 03:58:15 UTC] [MSG] @Darvit_Nu: @OaktownGirl the home made jerky is so much better ... once you make some you'll know how bad the store stuff tastes lol!
[02:09:55 / 2024-10-04 03:58:20 UTC] [MSG] @mikecayen8580: Thanks :)
[02:10:01 / 2024-10-04 03:58:25 UTC] [MSG] @chris_carnivore_calisthenics: @OaktownGirl Absolutely! 💯 Today was a beef, butter, cheese day, but I usually have 6 eggs per day. The Dash cooker works well and you can experiment a little with amount of water, rest time, etc.
[02:10:11 / 2024-10-04 03:58:35 UTC] [MSG] @michaelbare5380: vegan kids don't get processed snacks like most kids.

[02:13:34 / 2024-10-04 04:01:58 UTC] [MSG] @chris_carnivore_calisthenics: @Nick Sheesen 👍 It's convenient. I cook the eggs while my burgers or steak are cooking, and the have cooling time while I'm eating the beef, and best of all. No cleanup!
[02:13:51 / 2024-10-04 04:02:15 UTC] [MSG] @KoppersKitchen: @EasymodeRL HEY! Was that a test for the mods?????????????????? ;-)

[02:56:54 / 2024-10-04 04:45:18 UTC] [MSG] @Dtsar-ny8en: Dr chaffee, carnivore makes complete sense to me in terms of health and so on. My only concern is that the lack of carbs will lower the amount of insulin produced, which is counterproductive for teens
[02:57:03 / 2024-10-04 04:45:27 UTC] [MSG] @buffaloant: ima get some wings soon
[02:57:40 / 2024-10-04 04:46:04 UTC] [MSG] @Dtsar-ny8en: As carbs are needed for greater insulim signaling, and insulin increases igf1
[02:57:56 / 2024-10-04 04:46:20 UTC] [MSG] @chris_carnivore_calisthenics: Thank you, all! This is wrapping up just in time, as I have my blue blockers on and getting ready for bed. Great mods and participants as always!!!

[02:59:16 / 2024-10-04 04:47:40 UTC] [MSG] @brandonstaples7300: Hi I've been eating meat mostly now and feel more relaxed but some people still look down upon people who only eat meat.
[02:59:31 / 2024-10-04 04:47:55 UTC] [MSG] @SkinnySRT8: Thank you, kappers carnivore . I will check it out
[02:59:40 / 2024-10-04 04:48:04 UTC] [MSG] @Dtsar-ny8en: I know gluconeogenesis occurs in teens too, but surely it can’t compete with the higher insulin signaling from higher carb intake. 
[02:59:57 / 2024-10-04 04:48:21 UTC] [MSG] @ramenra8942: Bye guys thanks for the insights and kind words
[02:59:59 / 2024-10-04 04:48:23 UTC] [MSG] @MrBDezno: I see
[03:00:02 / 2024-10-04 04:48:26 UTC] [MSG] @Dtsar-ny8en: This is the only real concern I have

[03:02:54 / 2024-10-04 04:51:18 UTC] [MSG] @MrBDezno: I had a nurse who told me she has to avoid meat because of her kidneys.
[03:02:58 / 2024-10-04 04:51:22 UTC] [MSG] @loriwilson-n9t: Diabetic teens maybe but other than that … don’t think carnivore should be detrimental to teens…
[03:02:59 / 2024-10-04 04:51:24 UTC] [MSG] @KoppersKitchen: Exactly @Laura N 
[03:03:39 / 2024-10-04 04:52:03 UTC] [MSG] @latrogeniwile58: I've been dealing with T2D for 30 years. Q ?
