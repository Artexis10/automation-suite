[00:04:31 / 2024-01-12 01:14:04 UTC] [MSG] @neilyakuza6595: Do you think part of the carnivore lifestyle heals the body because of the L- Glutamine intake going up because of the meat? I heard that L-Glutamine helps with wall gut, intestinal healing.

[00:06:25 / 2024-01-12 01:15:58 UTC] [MSG] @KetogenicSusan: yeah i dont track calories or any macros. Sure i might lose weight alittle faster if I did but i dont want to be bothered tracking the rest of my life. 
[00:06:38 / 2024-01-12 01:16:11 UTC] [MSG] @Darvit_Nu: @Erdwin32 most of us don't track calories at all. It's really hard to over eat on carnivore! Just eat when hungry until meat stops tasting good.
