[02:26:12 / 2023-12-22 03:36:39 UTC] [MSG] @1Hope4All: Linda Straub Carnivores don't have to worry about VitC. Since we don't eat Carbs, the absorption of C is much better. Carbs block C which is why Vit C is pushed so much. Carnivores don't need as much

[02:27:04 / 2023-12-22 03:37:31 UTC] [MSG] @Metqa: @1Hope4All i think the question is where does the vitamin c come from. It's not in eggs, and she doesn't want to eat liver, ( or kidney?) so what are other options?
[02:27:08 / 2023-12-22 03:37:35 UTC] [MSG] @Epona52: @Neri Chapman - Exactly! Carnivore may well be more effective AND you'll have non-scale benefits that are just as good.

[02:34:44 / 2023-12-22 03:45:11 UTC] [MSG] @mbaleey8561: Not all African American Men have the same bloodtype or even haplogroup, so I'm hard pressed that all of them would have the same bio chemestry to where red meat would increase prostate issue.
[02:34:55 / 2023-12-22 03:45:22 UTC] [MSG] @moin8982: @Kooper's Carnivore Kitchen Yes, that's probably true, I just like to have average guidelines as a rough reference point, that keeps motivation high 😁
[02:34:59 / 2023-12-22 03:45:26 UTC] [MSG] @Metqa: @Linda Straub here: (2007) research published in Meat Science Journal confirms that fresh beef has approximately 1.6 mcg/g of vitamin C in grain-fed meat, and 2.56 mcg/g in grass-fed meat. [20] [1]

[02:35:45 / 2023-12-22 03:46:12 UTC] [MSG] @Darvit_Nu: @Dan You could try electolytes to help at least for the transition period for a bit to help you over the hurdle. I was fatigued & it helped taking them for a couple of days. 
[02:35:47 / 2023-12-22 03:46:13 UTC] [MSG] @KoppersKitchen: @Dan Be as strict as you can and I promise it will be so worth it! I can walk unassisted again and I can freaking shovel snow like I have not been able to do for over 5 years!
