[01:06:28 / 2024-01-05 02:15:40 UTC] [MSG] @PolishMike1993: Sugar free is not always sugar free. It usually has artificial sweeteners like xylitol

[01:06:33 / 2024-01-05 02:15:45 UTC] [MSG] @davidfraser6083: Hair loss is due to aponeurotica tightness in the scalp, reducing blood flow. Said to be tied to DHT but this is only an issue with scalp tightness due to holding trauma or stress in these muscles.
