[01:07:28 / 2024-05-10 02:33:28 UTC] [MSG] @Darvit_Nu: @chargermopar (Rick) absolutely! when babies are little they say to only feed egg yolks with a little butter or momma milk to test first since the whites are more prone to allergies.

[01:08:43 / 2024-05-10 02:34:44 UTC] [MSG] @Livingwell_awakened: I tired cooking in tallow vs bitter but I don’t care for the taste . So I started using some butter with tallow. The butter helps the flavor and helps keep the tallow from popping and making a mess.
[01:08:45 / 2024-05-10 02:34:45 UTC] [MSG] @Darvit_Nu: Duck or goose fat are good for cooking too. I used to keep a glass jar in the freezer... but it's gone now lol
