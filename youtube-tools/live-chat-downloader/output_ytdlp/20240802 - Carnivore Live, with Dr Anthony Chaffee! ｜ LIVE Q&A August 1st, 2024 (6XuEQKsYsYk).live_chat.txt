[00:00:00 / 2024-08-02 01:35:15 UTC] [MSG] @prismbunny: Oh! One last thing. I'm starting to crave meat nowadays instead of sugar/carbs. I never knew I'd have that switch.
[00:00:00 / 2024-08-02 01:35:17 UTC] [MSG] @chargermopar: Thanks @Darvit Nu And my blood pressure is lower now than at age 15
[00:00:00 / 2024-08-02 01:35:38 UTC] [MSG] @chargermopar: See, I am not the only one who craves meat

[00:00:00 / 2024-08-02 01:36:02 UTC] [MSG] @PolishMike1993: There is no need to fast on carnivore diet. You can if you want, but is not necessary to achieve optimal health, unless high ketosis state is needed for things like mental health and cancer management
[00:00:00 / 2024-08-02 01:36:09 UTC] [MSG] @bertkistoo3272: TY, Nick

[00:00:00 / 2024-08-02 01:37:06 UTC] [MSG] @Darvit_Nu: @Bert Kistoo if you're coming off of a highly processed diet like SAD, it might be easier to just switch first. A plant or carb -centric diet makes it really difficult to fast, your preference though
[00:00:00 / 2024-08-02 01:37:15 UTC] [MSG] @CalmCowBell: Went primal for dinner and ate a T bone with my fingers - no fork or knife - yummers!

[00:00:00 / 2024-08-02 01:38:07 UTC] [MSG] @NickSheesenYT: Hiya Patty, excellent point ☝
[00:00:00 / 2024-08-02 01:38:19 UTC] [MSG] @prismbunny: I naturally only eat once or twice during the day and carnivore (and keto too) makes it where I don't feel the need to eat every 4-5 hours.

[00:00:00 / 2024-08-02 01:39:31 UTC] [MSG] @prismbunny: Oh, yeah, I ate my chicken quarter with my fingers. I felt a little weird doing that but I dug in anyway! Haha.
[00:00:00 / 2024-08-02 01:39:32 UTC] [MSG] @NickSheesenYT: Bunny, I time restrict but today I've eaten 3 times. Usually 2.

[02:39:54 / 2024-08-02 04:20:38 UTC] [MSG] @Darvit_Nu: HDL & LDL are lipids that act like taxis. LDL carries fat-soluble nutrients from the liver to cells & whatever nutrients aren't used the HDL comes by, picks up the excess to the liver for recycling.

[02:40:08 / 2024-08-02 04:20:52 UTC] [MSG] @KoppersKitchen: @Merrick Hutson There is a lot more info in those videos 🙂
[02:40:12 / 2024-08-02 04:20:56 UTC] [MSG] @chris_carnivore_calisthenics: @Kopper's Carnivore Kitchen 👍 ♥ on the fatty, cold-water fish! You really have a great variety of yummy foods!
[02:40:24 / 2024-08-02 04:21:08 UTC] [MSG] @Darvit_Nu: Both LDL & HDL are essential for proper healing without them, your body can't heal or fight anything off.
[02:40:49 / 2024-08-02 04:21:33 UTC] [MSG] @KoppersKitchen: @Christopher Thompson I am very lucky with the seafood for sure, i have fresh shrimp and scallops coming too, then pretty soon crab season 🙂

[02:41:06 / 2024-08-02 04:21:50 UTC] [MSG] @RosalindChaffee: @K Z - normal medical stuff is appropriate. Special tests on carnivore aren't necessary.
[02:41:17 / 2024-08-02 04:22:01 UTC] [MSG] @CrackTheCodeSports: in December 2023 I was 283 lbs and my docotor warned me i was pre diabetic. 85 days on Carnivore reversed that now my A1C is 5.4!!! Amazing 
[02:41:27 / 2024-08-02 04:22:11 UTC] [MSG] @Darvit_Nu: LDL & HDL also carry cholesterol to the cells to form proper, healthy cell membranes as well as use by the brain.

[02:46:31 / 2024-08-02 04:27:15 UTC] [MSG] @CrackTheCodeSports: ok.. the morning of my labs i walked .6 miles to the hospital and fasted prior to the testing

[02:47:18 / 2024-08-02 04:28:01 UTC] [MSG] @RosalindChaffee: @Golden State Pro Painters remember you get your test surge in the a.m. and it dissipates through the day so first thing is best
[02:47:38 / 2024-08-02 04:28:22 UTC] [MSG] @Darvit_Nu: Children naturally have higher lipid levels as well (LDL & HDL) no one should be reducing the "taxi" system 😊Triglycerides are a different story...
[02:47:44 / 2024-08-02 04:28:27 UTC] [MSG] @NickSheesenYT: PeLar, it's predominantly fructose so it's not recommended

[02:49:26 / 2024-08-02 04:30:10 UTC] [MSG] @Fireinthedark8: I think it’s still better to eat a tea spoon of natural organic honey than giving into anything else that’s sugary. 
[02:49:42 / 2024-08-02 04:30:26 UTC] [MSG] @CrackTheCodeSports: .6 mile walk from home to the hospital, I'll update next week what the levels are Thank you @Rosalind 
[02:49:48 / 2024-08-02 04:30:32 UTC] [MSG] @therealdeal3672: Pe'Lar H Honey is fructose which is very hard on the liver, just like alcohol. Also honey is so sweet it will throw you into cravings for sweetness
[02:49:49 / 2024-08-02 04:30:33 UTC] [MSG] @Darvit_Nu: @Golden State Pro Painters I'd say to drive instead. Exercise messes with some bloodwork markers. Also if you're testing "cholesterol" I'd watch Dave Feldman for his protocol on YouTube. 
[02:49:50 / 2024-08-02 04:30:34 UTC] [MSG] @RosalindChaffee: @zeus czar del rosario he's going to tell you no caffeine and that will help your overall energy levels once you clear it from your system
