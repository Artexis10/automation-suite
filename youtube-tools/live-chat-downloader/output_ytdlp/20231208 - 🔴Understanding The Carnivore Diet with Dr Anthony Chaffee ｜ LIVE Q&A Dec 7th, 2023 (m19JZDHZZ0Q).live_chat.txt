[00:26:50 / 2023-12-08 01:37:35 UTC] [MSG] @adelarsen9776: @chargermopar (The 40 year carnivore) I do steak 3 days a week, ground beef twice a week and the rest of the time I do lamb. So it's ruminant city at my place.
[00:26:58 / 2023-12-08 01:37:43 UTC] [MSG] @PolishMike1993: I think I could handle 3lbs of fatty meats with tallow in one sitting. But once I reach a point I need to eat more than that, I may split to 2MAD
