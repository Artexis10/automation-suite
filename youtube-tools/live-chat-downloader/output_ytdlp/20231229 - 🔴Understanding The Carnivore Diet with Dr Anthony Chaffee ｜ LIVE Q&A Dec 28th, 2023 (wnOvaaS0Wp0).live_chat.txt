[00:27:57 / 2023-12-29 01:36:21 UTC] [MSG] @Darvit_Nu: @AndyC77 you could try taking some unflavored plain electrolytes in water to see if it helps. They're low & balanced enough that it should even everything out for you if that's the issue. :)

[01:12:35 / 2023-12-29 02:20:59 UTC] [MSG] @andyc7747: @DS111 really shocking isnt it. Crazy how far people are willing to go for and addictive substance. 
[01:12:52 / 2023-12-29 02:21:15 UTC] [MSG] @PolishMike1993: No need to supplement if you don't have deficiencies
[01:12:58 / 2023-12-29 02:21:22 UTC] [MSG] @TheAuteurist23: Great stream as always, thanks Dr Chaffee!
[01:13:02 / 2023-12-29 02:21:26 UTC] [MSG] @BBooey: Dr Chaffee, why don't some of the carnivore influencers / doctors involved in the community take the message to some of the larger meat focused companies like Tyson in an effort to spread the message?
[01:13:08 / 2023-12-29 02:21:32 UTC] [MSG] @irish_soul4043: Kelly Hogan said she's incorporated more fish like sardines and salmon...
[01:13:13 / 2023-12-29 02:21:37 UTC] [MSG] @aliceroberts7437: Supplements are mostly a scam
[01:13:13 / 2023-12-29 02:21:37 UTC] [MSG] @SvetlanaVladimirova8590: @pRAWimalMike Totally agree. Never took a supplement in my life
[01:13:18 / 2023-12-29 02:21:42 UTC] [MSG] @IrishKnightLight: yeah I was on my daily walk and saw this obese guy in a scooter just chain smoking. made me feel sick for him.
[01:13:18 / 2023-12-29 02:21:42 UTC] [MSG] @BBooey: Surely their boards of directors would love the free advertising that meat is the optimal diet?
[01:13:40 / 2023-12-29 02:22:04 UTC] [MSG] @PolishMike1993: If you feel deficient in something, get checked, try fixing diet first and if you cannot, reach for supplements then
[01:13:46 / 2023-12-29 02:22:10 UTC] [MSG] @Darvit_Nu: @Svetlana Vladimirova The worst thing the world could have decided was to feed their people the S.A.D. American government recommendations. I was yelling at my screen "Nooooo! Don't listen!"
[01:13:55 / 2023-12-29 02:22:19 UTC] [SUPERCHAT] @marshamurray111: Thank you for your information. I just started learning about carnivore and have learned a lot from you. 
[01:14:13 / 2023-12-29 02:22:37 UTC] [MSG] @PolishMike1993: But also go with how you feel, the ranges are skewed anyway
[01:14:24 / 2023-12-29 02:22:48 UTC] [MSG] @lindabongo5019: @DS111 every time I go shopping I notice this. I appreciate how quick shopping is now .
[01:14:39 / 2023-12-29 02:23:02 UTC] [MSG] @andyc7747: @DS111 Absolutely. We are/have all been victims of this corruption
[01:14:54 / 2023-12-29 02:23:18 UTC] [MSG] @chargermopar: I believe that feeling good is an important signal of health
[01:14:55 / 2023-12-29 02:23:19 UTC] [MSG] @KimberlyAnn60: we have to remember that our food source is going to determine whether we need to supplement. a lot of our meat and vegetables do not contain enough nutrients as they did 50 years ago or more.
[01:14:59 / 2023-12-29 02:23:23 UTC] [MSG] @SvetlanaVladimirova8590: @I am Darvit It's more American fast food. People love KFC here. I tried it once. I couldn't finish it
[01:15:10 / 2023-12-29 02:23:34 UTC] [MSG] @Darvit_Nu: @DS111 absolutely! It is so sad!! The information is out there and it's free... they just have to look & find it. 🙏

[01:15:24 / 2023-12-29 02:23:48 UTC] [MSG] @chargermopar: KFC is terrible compared to Heart Attack Chicken
[01:15:40 / 2023-12-29 02:24:04 UTC] [MSG] @jilld6240: Seed oils are worse than sugar I just learned.
[01:15:53 / 2023-12-29 02:24:17 UTC] [MSG] @cj548: @Linda Bongo .. right just walk in and out
[01:16:12 / 2023-12-29 02:24:36 UTC] [MSG] @mingkee27: I'd eat Boston Market where is available
[01:16:12 / 2023-12-29 02:24:36 UTC] [MSG] @SvetlanaVladimirova8590: Some people here still think is "sophisticated" to sit in a KFC, looking "American" 
[01:16:15 / 2023-12-29 02:24:39 UTC] [MSG] @omarhassan1889: Hello hope your well how come not many high level athletes are not on the carnivore diet like I would try it but I'm flustered that will it decrease performance as I do muay thai
[01:16:40 / 2023-12-29 02:25:04 UTC] [MSG] @Darvit_Nu: @Svetlana Vladimirova I agree! How I ever ate it and liked it, I'll never understand! Best thing ever is getting complemented on home cooking! 
[01:16:49 / 2023-12-29 02:25:13 UTC] [MSG] @andyc7747: @Svetlana Vladimirova that is such an interesting response from you fellow Russians
[01:16:54 / 2023-12-29 02:25:18 UTC] [MSG] @KetogenicSusan: @Svetlana Vladimirova I never knew setting in a kfc was considered sophisticated. Bizarre

[01:17:29 / 2023-12-29 02:25:53 UTC] [MSG] @PolishMike1993: @Briar, precisely. Don't take supplements if there is no medical rationale. Lots of people taking iodine for no reason because some doctors advised them too but are you deficient? Having symptoms?
[01:17:29 / 2023-12-29 02:25:53 UTC] [MSG] @Cutestmostsweetest: QQQQ started Dec.1, carb craving free Dec.21 but I feel gaining weight. I cut out heavy cream two days ago but feeling discouraged 🫤

[01:17:48 / 2023-12-29 02:26:12 UTC] [MSG] @SvetlanaVladimirova8590: Well, we see a lot of US movies here. People go to KFC with laptops to look cool. What a joke!
[01:17:51 / 2023-12-29 02:26:15 UTC] [MSG] @PolishMike1993: You can harm yourself by supplements when not needed
[01:18:01 / 2023-12-29 02:26:25 UTC] [MSG] @redhood888: @Dr Chaffee I’ve recently come to know of you. Are you able to generally answer everyone’s questions on live? I would love to ask you a few questions.
[01:18:09 / 2023-12-29 02:26:33 UTC] [MSG] @EricBosse-x3n: I am wet fasting 72 hours on weekends and have resolved the last 10% of my MS. Time to rebuild my leg muscles and Walk again. Au revoir RRMS !!!

[01:18:27 / 2023-12-29 02:26:51 UTC] [MSG] @Darvit_Nu: @Omar Hassan There are more & more athletes coming forward about their diets. I think the stigma caused so many to just keep quiet about what they're really eating. 
[01:18:45 / 2023-12-29 02:27:09 UTC] [MSG] @chargermopar: I never supplement

[01:19:39 / 2023-12-29 02:28:03 UTC] [MSG] @SvetlanaVladimirova8590: @DS111 The KFC I tried tasted like a ton of salt and sugar. It's a US secret weapon
[01:19:40 / 2023-12-29 02:28:04 UTC] [MSG] @Darvit_Nu: @chargermopar (The 40 year carnivore) right? Ditch the breading & just give us the meat! 😂

[03:02:36 / 2023-12-29 04:11:00 UTC] [MSG] @diegocaleiro: @Kopper's Carnivore Kitchen did you ever look up "Vegan diet" and "carnivore diet" on google trends, the last 5 years? It's an X :)
[03:02:47 / 2023-12-29 04:11:11 UTC] [MSG] @diegocaleiro: we're winning the diet wars
[03:03:10 / 2023-12-29 04:11:34 UTC] [MSG] @joeguammusic: I grabbed a 10” Victorinox Cimiter breaking knife, love it.
[03:03:20 / 2023-12-29 04:11:44 UTC] [MSG] @Darvit_Nu: @After the Healing Ministry you can eat more fat to encourage your body to move things along. 🙂 It works great & won't mess up digestion.
[03:03:21 / 2023-12-29 04:11:45 UTC] [MSG] @ZenBullie84: @jennifer Marlowe - we do that w/ friends from a local farmer. So grateful for it 
[03:03:23 / 2023-12-29 04:11:47 UTC] [MSG] @KoppersKitchen: @Dr Giego Caleiro it sure would be great if we at least got closer to it!

[03:03:41 / 2023-12-29 04:12:05 UTC] [MSG] @KoppersKitchen: @Joe Guam Music They are the best knives ever for meat in my book!!
[03:03:43 / 2023-12-29 04:12:07 UTC] [MSG] @chris_carnivore_calisthenics: I so wanted a Victorinox, but the price was a little more than desired, so I went with a Richlin. Chinese, but had high ratings and less than 1/2 the price
[03:03:56 / 2023-12-29 04:12:20 UTC] [MSG] @jennifermarlow.: Kellie, that's awesome! (I don't know how to address comments, ack) 
[03:04:07 / 2023-12-29 04:12:31 UTC] [MSG] @diegocaleiro: @Annabella the happy carnivore I'm doing a specific thing the "Steak and butter gang" specifically Coah Raymond, seem to do, you eat like a fat king 2 weeks, then you reduce meals a day until 1, ADF
[03:04:23 / 2023-12-29 04:12:47 UTC] [MSG] @ZenBullie84: Me neither Jennifer! 😆 
[03:04:24 / 2023-12-29 04:12:48 UTC] [MSG] @joeguammusic: I have a Japanese kiritsuke knife that’s my absolute favorite, but the Victorinox breaking and boning knives definitely have their purposes.
[03:04:30 / 2023-12-29 04:12:53 UTC] [MSG] @KoppersKitchen: @Christopher Thompson Please let me know how you like it. Someone asked me about that brand the other day and I did not have an answer

[03:04:41 / 2023-12-29 04:13:05 UTC] [MSG] @diegocaleiro: I also have done 3 and even 7 day fast once in the past. 
[03:05:26 / 2023-12-29 04:13:50 UTC] [MSG] @jennifermarlow.: Chicken thighs have more taurine and other essentials, so I only eat them .. but, you can make butter chicken with breasts, and it is absolutely delish! 
[03:05:50 / 2023-12-29 04:14:14 UTC] [MSG] @Darvit_Nu: @After the Healing Ministry let us know how you're doing. The dietary change has a conversion time but it should only take a few days for your body to adjust & the gut biome to switch over.

[03:06:06 / 2023-12-29 04:14:30 UTC] [MSG] @diegocaleiro: Yeah, I was here in your sophia interview, I saw you talk about Berkeley and we briefly talked particle physics and Anthropology

[03:09:30 / 2023-12-29 04:17:54 UTC] [MSG] @chris_carnivore_calisthenics: @Kopper's Carnivore Kitchen They were $12.49 not long ago. How high are they in AK? I'm afraid to ask, but curious. I know everything there is high
[03:10:13 / 2023-12-29 04:18:37 UTC] [MSG] @mybricksters9800: Anybody else crush up pork skins to use for breading on there fish. It was yummy
